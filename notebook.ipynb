The College strives to attract a diverse, multitalented, intellectually adventurous \\nstudent body. In selecting the first-year class, the Committee pays close attention to a variety \\nof factors; these include a student’s academic achievements, extracurricular involvements, and \\npotential to contribute to the Bowdoin community.\\nBowdoin requires all applicants to submit the Common Application or the Coalition \\nApplication, and complete the additional essay. The Common Application and Coalition \\nApplication are available online and provide students a uniform framework to present their \\ncredentials. No preference is given between the two applications.\\nWhile no single factor determines a candidate’s eligibility for admission, Bowdoin College is, \\nfirst and foremost, an academic institution. Therefore, an applicant’s high school performance \\nand the level of challenge represented by the course work are of particular concern to the \\nmembers of the Admissions Committee. Each applicant must make arrangements with the \\nappropriate high school administrator to submit all official high school transcripts. The \\nAdmissions Committee strives to understand each student’s performance in the proper context \\nand therefore requires high school administrators to submit a Secondary School Report \\n(SSR) and a High School Profile. Doing so enables the Committee to properly interpret \\nthe information presented on the transcript(s). Ideally, the profile illuminates individual \\nhigh school policies regarding issues such as weighting of grades, rank in class, Honors/\\nAP/ IB course offerings, etc. Comments from school officials on the SSR as well as letters of \\nrecommendation from two teachers who have taught the student in an academic core subject \\n(core subjects include English, math, lab sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages) can \\nalso help the Admissions Office better understand a prospective student’s preparation for \\nBowdoin. Since 1969, the College has made the submission of standardized testing an optional \\npart of the application. Prospective students may decide whether or not their individual test \\nresults will enhance their academic profile and application. Exceptions to the score-optional \\npolicy include home-schooled students and students who attend high schools that do not issue \\ngrades. These applicants are required to submit results from either the ACT or the SAT and \\ntwo SAT subject tests. The subject tests must include either Math Level 1 or Math Level 2 and \\na science test.\\nBecause of the residential nature of the College, the strong emphasis on community values, \\nand a core belief in collaboration and the open exchange of ideas both in and beyond the \\nclassroom, the Admissions Committee does not limit its assessment to a student’s transcript \\nand testing. Students have the opportunity, through the personal statement and the \\nsupplement, to reveal the quality and depth of their thinking, their ability to communicate \\nideas in writing, and how they approach learning and the opportunity to interact with others. \\nStudents also detail the activities that have captured their interest, areas of accomplishment \\nand recognition, and how they have focused their energies outside the classroom. When \\npossible, applicants are encouraged to visit the campus for an interview or to meet with \\nan alumni representative. On-campus interviews are available from late May until early \\nDecember. Students who choose to interview with a Bowdoin alumnus or alumna must \\nsubmit their requests before December 1, 2018.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cFinancial Aid\\n\\nAll Early Decision and Regular Decision admissions decisions for US citizens and permanent \\nresidents are made under a “need-blind” policy. Under this policy, an applicant’s financial \\nresources are not a factor in determining whether or not the student will be admitted. While \\nBowdoin is committed to enrolling students from overseas, the College does observe a strict \\nbudget when supporting non-residents. Therefore, admission for non-US citizens may \\ntake a family’s financial resources into consideration. To be eligible for financial assistance, \\ninternational students must apply for aid when submitting their application for admission. All \\nstudents who anticipate needing financial aid are required to complete an aid application. See \\nFinancial Aid, below, for more details. Since the fall of 2016, Bowdoin waives the application \\nfee for any student applying for financial aid from the College, and/or for first-generation \\nstudents (neither parent has a degree from a four-year institution).\\nMore information is available at bowdoin.edu/admissions.\\n\\nFinancial Aid\\n\\nAt Bowdoin, more than 46 percent of enrolled students receive some amount of grant \\nassistance to help pay for college costs. Grant aid reduces billed charges on a dollar-for-dollar \\nbasis and does not require repayment. With the exception of transfer, international, and \\nstudents admitted from the wait list, admission to Bowdoin is “need blind\"—admission does \\nnot consider a student’s economic status. Bowdoin’s financial aid meets 100 percent of a \\nstudent’s demonstrated need.\\nEligibility for Bowdoin grant assistance is “need based,” determined through an analysis of \\nincome, asset, and other family information submitted on the CSS PROFILE, federal FAFSA, \\nand federal income tax returns. Bowdoin does not offer merit-based scholarships or grants, \\nwith the exception of those awarded through the National Merit Scholarship program.\\nBowdoin uses a proprietary need analysis system to determine grant eligibility, while state \\nand federal assistance programs use the federal methodology (FM) formula. As such, awards \\nmay vary from college to college, depending on institutional policies and the formula used to \\ndetermine need.\\nWhen determining institutional grant eligibility, Bowdoin evaluates each family’s financial \\ncapacity to contribute to college costs. Financial aid supplements family resources to enable \\nstudents from all economic backgrounds to attend the College.\\nBowdoin meets financial need with grant money from federal, state, and institutional sources, \\nand a small work award. Eligible students and parents seeking assistance to pay remaining \\nbilled charges may elect to borrow from available loan programs. Most Bowdoin students work \\nduring the summer and approximately 70 percent work on campus during the academic year \\nto pay for books, supplies, personal expenses, and travel.\\nIn most cases, receipt of private scholarships from outside sources does not affect Bowdoin \\ngrant awards.\\nFinancial aid eligibility is determined annually. Awards may increase or decrease from year to \\nyear due to changes in circumstances. Fairness and equitable treatment guide Bowdoin’s  \\nneed- analysis practices. Families with similar financial circumstances receive similar levels of \\ngrant support.\\nFor more information about Bowdoin’s Student Aid program, go to bowdoin.edu/studentaid.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cExpenses\\n\\nCollege Charges\\n\\n \\n\\nFees for the 2018–2019 academic year are listed below. Travel, books, and personal expenses \\nare not included; students must budget for such items on their own. For planning purposes, \\nstudents and parents should anticipate that tuition and other charges will increase each year to \\nreflect program changes and other cost increases experienced by the College.\\n \\nTuition* \\nHousing \\nBoard (19-meal plan) \\nStudent Activities Fee* \\nClass Dues*: \\n \\nSeniors \\n \\nOther classes \\nHealth Insurance (See Health Care section, page 14.)\\n* Required fees for all students.\\n\\nBy Semester \\n$26,709 \\n3,434 \\n3,915 \\n252 \\n \\n30 \\n15 \\n\\nFull Year\\n$53,418\\n6,868\\n7,830\\n504\\n\\n60\\n30\\n\\nOff-Campus Study Fee\\nThe College assesses a fee for participation in off-campus study programs. The fee for \\n2018–2019 is $1,000 per program.\\n\\nRegistration and Enrollment\\nAll continuing students are required to register for courses during registration “rounds” held \\nduring the prior semester in accordance with the schedules posted at the College. Any student \\nwho initially registers after the first week of classes must pay a $50 late fee. All students are \\nfurther required to submit an Enrollment Form by the end of the first week of classes. While \\nregistration places students in courses, the Enrollment Form serves to notify the College that \\nthe student is on campus and attending classes. A fee of $50 is assessed for late submission of \\nthe Enrollment Form.\\n\\nPayment of College Bills\\nBy registering for courses, a student incurs a legal obligation to pay tuition and fees. This \\ndebt may be canceled only if a student officially withdraws from the College before the start \\nof classes. Students’ accounts must be current (namely, payment of all outstanding balances, \\nincluding any past due balances) for semester enrollment and course registration to occur. \\nA student with a past due account will not be permitted to register for courses or to enroll \\nwithout the written consent of the College. After the first week of classes, students who have \\nnot enrolled for any reason are dropped from courses. A student’s access to their residence hall, \\nmeal plan, and the library is deactivated at that time. The student is placed on an involuntary \\nleave of absence for the semester (see Academic Standards and Regulations, pages 24–41). \\nDegrees, diplomas, and transcripts are not available to students with overdue accounts.\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cExpenses\\n\\nBills for tuition, board, room rent, and fees for the fall and spring semesters are generated and \\nposted online in July and December, respectively. Bills are delivered electronically to students \\nwho are enrolled or participating in off-campus study programs. Email notifications are \\ndirected to the students’ Bowdoin email accounts. Payment for each semester is due thirty days \\nfrom the billing date.\\nPayment may be made by the semester due date, by installment payment plan over the course \\nof the semester, or by combining the two options. Payment plans may be arranged with \\nTuition Management Systems (TMS); Bowdoin does not operate its own in-house payment \\nplan. Credit cards are not accepted in payment of college charges.\\n\\nWithdrawals and Refunds\\nStudents leaving the College during the course of a semester are refunded tuition and fees \\nbased on the following schedule:\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks ....................................................................80%\\nDuring the third week...........................................................................60%\\nDuring the fourth week.........................................................................40%\\nDuring the fifth week............................... .............................................20%\\nOver five weeks ............................................................................No refund\\n\\nAfter adjustments for fixed commitments and applicable overhead expense, refunds for room \\nand board are prorated on a daily basis in accordance with the student’s attendance based on \\nthe College’s calendar. Students who are dismissed from the College within the first five weeks \\nfor other than academic or medical reasons are not entitled to refunds. \\nCollege grants, in coordination with other funds received, will be credited in proportion to \\neducational expenses, but in no case will they exceed total charges to be collected. Title IV \\nfunds (Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Grant, and Federal Direct Loans) will be \\nrefunded to the source in accordance with federal regulations and in the proscribed order. \\nFederal funds are earned based on the number of days the student is in attendance for the \\nsemester. There is no federal refund after the student has attended 60 percent of the semester. \\nUnearned Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funds are returned to the source on \\na proportional basis through at least the 60 percent portion of the period for which the \\nfunds apply. Refunds will be made within thirty days of the student’s departure or date of \\ndetermination of the student’s departure, whichever is later.\\nIn the case of a student who must withdraw because of activation for military service, the \\nCollege will work to identify solutions that will not result in additional student debt for the \\nrequired return of funds providing the student’s bill was paid in full prior to the withdrawal.\\n\\nFinancial Aid\\nThere are opportunities at Bowdoin to receive financial aid in meeting the charge for tuition. \\nInformation about scholarships and other financial aid may be found on page 11.\\n\\nRoom and Board\\nFirst-year students and sophomores are guaranteed housing and are required to live on \\ncampus. Entering first-year students may indicate their residence preferences online the \\nsummer preceding their arrival at Bowdoin. The Office of Residential Life coordinates housing \\naccommodations for the remaining classes through a lottery system.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cExpenses\\n\\nResidence hall suites consist of bedroom(s) and a common room and are furnished with \\nessential furniture. College property is not to be removed from the building or from the \\nroom in which it belongs; occupants are held responsible for any damage to their rooms or \\nfurnishings.\\nBoard charges are the same regardless of whether a student eats at the Moulton Union or \\nThorne Hall. Students who live in Bowdoin facilities, except apartments and a few other \\nstudent residences, are required to take a 19-meal, 14-meal, or 10-meal residential board plan. \\nFirst-year students are required to take the 19-meal plan for their entire first year on campus. \\nStudents living in College apartments or off campus may purchase a 9-meal or declining \\nbalance board plan or one of the residential plans, if they choose.\\n\\nOther College Charges\\nAll damage to the buildings or other property of the College by persons unknown may be \\nassessed equally on all residents of the building in which the damage occurred. The Student \\nActivities Fee is set by the student government, and its expenditure is allocated by the Student \\nActivities Fee Committee.\\n\\nHealth Care\\nThe facilities of the Peter Buck Center for Health and Fitness and the Counseling Service are \\navailable to all students. All students must maintain health insurance coverage while enrolled \\nat Bowdoin. The College offers its own policy for those students who do not carry comparable \\ninsurance. The College’s policy provides year-round coverage, whether a student is enrolled \\nat Bowdoin or in an approved off-campus study program. The full-year accident and sickness \\ninsurance plan costs $1,895.\\nA pamphlet specifying the coverage provided by the student health policy is available from \\nthe health center and will be mailed in the summer preceding the policy year. Any costs not \\ncovered by the insurance will be charged to the student’s account.\\n\\nMotor Vehicles\\nAll motor vehicles, including motorcycles and motor scooters, used on campus or owned and/\\nor operated by residents of any College-owned residence, must be registered with the Office \\nof Safety and Security. The registration decals cost $40 and are valid for the academic year in \\nwhich they are purchased. Vehicles must be reregistered each academic year. Students wishing \\nto register a vehicle for a period of time less than one semester must make special arrangements \\nwith the Office of Safety and Security. All students maintaining motor vehicles at the College \\nare required to carry adequate liability insurance. The College assumes no responsibility for \\nthe security of or damage to vehicles parked on campus. Parking on campus is limited and \\nstudents will be assigned parking space based on availability. Comprehensive information \\nregarding motor vehicles and campus parking is available at bowdoin.edu/security/parking/ \\nand in the Bowdoin College Student Handbook online at bowdoin.edu/studentaffairs/\\nstudent-handbook/.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cA Liberal Education at Bowdoin College\\n\\nWilliam DeWitt Hyde’s “The Offer of the College” (page 9) spelled out a vision of the aspirations \\nof a liberal education appropriate to the early twentieth century. Many elements of it still have \\ncurrency more than one hundred years later. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, a \\nvastly changed College in a dramatically altered world provides a related but expanded offer—of \\nintellectual challenge and personal growth in the context of an active and engaged learning \\ncommunity closely linked to the social and natural worlds.\\nA liberal education cultivates the mind and the imagination; encourages seeking after truth, \\nmeaning, and beauty; awakens an appreciation of past traditions and present challenges; \\nfosters joy in learning and sharing that learning with others; supports taking the intellectual \\nrisks required to explore the unknown, test new ideas, and enter into constructive debate; and \\nbuilds the foundation for making principled judgments. It hones the capacity for critical and \\nopen intellectual inquiry—the interest in asking questions, challenging assumptions, seeking \\nanswers, and reaching conclusions supported by logic and evidence. A liberal education rests \\nfundamentally on the free exchange of ideas—on conversation and questioning—that thrives in \\nclassrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, studios, dining halls, playing fields, and residence halls. \\nUltimately, a liberal education promotes independent thinking, individual action, and social \\nresponsibility.\\nSince its opening in 1802, Bowdoin has understood the obligation to direct liberal education \\ntoward the common good. In the twenty-first century, that obligation is stronger than ever. \\nThe challenge of defining a “common good” and acting on it is highlighted, however, in an \\ninterconnected world of widely varied cultures, interests, resources, and power. To prepare \\nstudents for this complexity, a liberal education must teach about differences across cultures and \\nwithin societies. At the same time, it should help students understand and respect the values and \\nimplications of a shared natural world and human heritage. By doing so, a liberal education will \\nchallenge students to appreciate and contend with diversity and the conflicts inherent in differing \\nexperiences, perspectives, and values at the same time that they find ways to contribute to the \\ncommon project of living together in the world.\\nAlthough a liberal education is not narrowly vocational, it provides the broadest grounding for \\nfinding a vocation by preparing students to be engaged, adaptable, independent, and capable \\ncitizens.\\nA student in a residential liberal arts college is removed from many of the immediate \\nresponsibilities of daily adult life, making the four years of education extraordinarily privileged \\nones. Such an education, however, must engage that world—both contemporary and historical, \\nboth local and global. This engagement comes through individual and group research, service \\nlearning, volunteer activities, summer internships, off-campus study, and more.\\nThe success of a Bowdoin education is evident in the capacity of graduates to be informed \\nand critically analytic readers of texts, evidence, and conclusions; to be able to construct a \\nlogical argument; to communicate in writing and speaking with clarity and self-confidence; to \\nunderstand the nature of artistic creation and the character of critical aesthetic judgment; to \\nhave the capacity to use quantitative and graphical presentations of information critically and \\nconfidently; and to access, evaluate, and make effective use of information resources in varied \\nforms and media. These fundamental capacities serve as crucial supports for a commitment to \\nactive intellectual inquiry—to taking independent and multifaceted approaches to solving complex \\nproblems; knowing how to ask important and fruitful questions and to pursue answers critically \\nand effectively; sharing in the excitement of discovery and creativity; and being passionately \\ncommitted to a subject of study. Graduates should thus have the ability to engage competing views \\ncritically, to make principled judgments that inform their practice, and to work effectively with \\nothers as informed citizens committed to constructing a just and sustainable world.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cThe Mission of the College\\n\\nIt is the mission of the College to engage students of uncommon promise in an intense full- \\ntime education of their minds, exploration of their creative faculties, and development of their \\nsocial and leadership abilities in a four-year course of study and residence that concludes with \\na baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts.\\nTwo guiding ideas suffuse Bowdoin’s mission. The first, from the College of the eighteenth \\nand nineteenth centuries, defines education in terms of a social vision. “Literary institutions \\nare founded and endowed for the common good, and not for the private advantage of those \\nwho resort to them . . . but that their mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the \\nbenefit of society” (President Joseph McKeen’s inaugural address, 1802); “To lose yourself in \\ngenerous enthusiasms and cooperate with others for common ends . . . ; this is the offer of the \\nCollege” (President William DeWitt Hyde, 1903). The second idea stresses the formation of a \\ncomplete individual for a world in flux: there is an intrinsic value in a liberal arts education of \\nbreadth and depth, beyond the acquisition of specific knowledge, that will enable a thinking \\nperson “to be at home in all lands and all ages” (President Hyde).\\nAt the root of this mission is selection. First, and regardless of their wealth, Bowdoin selects \\nmen and women of varied gifts; diverse social, geographic, and racial backgrounds; and \\nexceptional qualities of mind and character. Developed in association with one another, these \\ngifts will enable them to become leaders in many fields of endeavor. Second, it recruits faculty \\nmembers of high intellectual ability and scholarly accomplishment who have a passion for \\neducation, both of undergraduates and of themselves, as life-long creators and pursuers of \\nknowledge.\\nThe College pursues its mission in five domains:\\n\\n1. Intellectual and Academic\\nThe great mission of the College is to instill in students the love, the ways, and the habit of \\nlearning.\\nGeneral education in the liberal arts. The academic disciplines are specialized modes of \\ninquiry through which human beings perceive and intellectually engage the world. Both their \\npower and their limits have led the College to make a long-standing commitment to general \\neducation. Specialist faculty cause non-specialist students to become critically acquainted \\nwith the perspectives and methods of disciplines in three general divisions of learning: the \\nnatural sciences, the humanities and the arts, and the social sciences. The College also sustains \\nprograms of interdisciplinary study to reveal complicated realities not disclosed by any single \\ndiscipline. It requires study outside the perspectives of Europe and the West; and it encourages \\nstudy abroad to foster students’ international awareness and linguistic mastery.\\nThe major field of study and independent work. Bowdoin places particular emphasis on the \\nacademic major, a concentrated engagement with the method and content of an academic \\ndiscipline, in which advanced students take increasing intellectual responsibility for their own \\neducation. The College provides opportunities for honors projects and independent study, \\nenabling students to engage in research and writing under the guidance of faculty mentors. \\nThe arrangement of teaching responsibilities of Bowdoin faculty presupposes professional \\nduties not only of original scholarship and creative work but also of supervision of advanced \\nstudent projects.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cThe Mission of the College\\n\\n \\nEssential skills. The unevenness of American secondary education, the diversity of student \\nbackgrounds, and the demands of college-level work and effective citizenship all require that \\nthe College enable students to master essential quantitative and writing skills and skills of oral \\ncommunication, with the guidance of faculty, other professionals, and qualified student peers.\\nThe College believes that technology is not education, but that it is changing both education \\nand society; and that it must be embraced by pedagogy and research and made easily and \\ndependably available to students, faculty, and staff.\\n\\n2. Social and Residential\\nBowdoin students are selected from a large pool of applicants for their intellectual ability, \\nseriousness of purpose, and personal qualities. By design, they differ widely in their \\nbackgrounds and talents—be they artistic, athletic, scientific, or otherwise. To enable such \\nstudents to learn from each other, and to make lasting friendships, the College is dedicated to \\ncreating a rewarding and congenial residence life, open to all students, which, with communal \\ndining, is at the core of the mission of a residential college. Bowdoin’s system is based on \\nresidence halls linked to restored, medium-sized, self-governing former fraternity houses.\\nThe College devotes the talent of staff and faculty, and of students themselves, to the creation \\nof opportunities for student growth and leadership in these residential contexts, reinforced by \\nmany volunteer programs and activities, student-run campus organizations, and opportunities \\nto plan careers.\\n\\n3. Athletic\\nIntercollegiate athletic competition against colleges with shared academic values, and other \\nnon-varsity sports, can foster self-control, poise, leadership, good health, and good humor. \\nBowdoin encourages student participation in professionally coached varsity and club \\nprograms, as well as intramural sports, and in an outing club program that enables students to \\nexplore and test themselves in Maine’s rivers and forests and on its seacoast and islands.\\n\\n4. Esthetic and Environmental\\nThe College is dedicated to constructing and preserving buildings and campus spaces of the \\nhighest quality, believing that their beauty and serenity shape campus intellectual and esthetic \\nlife and inform the sensibilities of students who as graduates will influence the quality of spaces \\nand buildings in their towns, businesses, and homes. A quadrangle of oaks and pines, ringed \\nwith historic architecture, and containing two museums with major collections of art and \\nArctic craft, deepens a Bowdoin student’s sense of place, history, and civilization.\\nAs a liberal arts college in Maine, Bowdoin assumes a particular responsibility to use nature \\nas a resource for teaching and engaging students—notably to help them obtain a broad sense \\nof the natural environment, local and global, and the effects and the role of human beings \\nregarding it.\\n\\n5. Ethical\\nImplicit in and explicit to its mission is the College’s commitment to creating a moral \\nenvironment, free of fear and intimidation, and where differences can flourish. Faculty and \\nstudents require honesty in academic work. Coaches instruct that fatigue and frustration are \\nno excuse for personal fouls. Deans and proctors set standards of probity and decency and \\nenforce them, with student participation, in College procedures. Yet, recognizing that life will \\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cThe Mission of the College\\npresent graduates with ambiguities that call for certainty less than for balance and judgment, \\nBowdoin makes few decisions for students, academically or socially—perhaps fewer than do \\nmany other residential colleges. It does so believing that students grow morally and sharpen \\npersonal identity by exercising free individual choice among varied alternatives, curricular \\nand social. But the College also causes these decisions to occur in a context of density and \\nvariety—of ideas, artistic expression, and exposure to other cultures and other races—so that \\npersonal identity will not become an illusion of centrality.\\nBowdoin College seeks to be a fair, encouraging employer of all those who serve the \\ninstitution, providing opportunities for professional development, promotion and personal \\ngrowth, and recognizing the value of each individual’s contribution to its educational mission.\\nFrom its history of more than two hundred years and its inheritance of buildings and \\nendowment that are the gifts of Bowdoin alumni there derives a corollary. If the College is to \\npursue its educational purposes in perpetuity, its mission is also a provident and prudential \\none. Succeeding generations of members of the College must carry the costs of their own \\nenjoyment of its benefits; as alumni they remain a part of Bowdoin, assuming responsibility for \\nrenewing the endowments and buildings that will keep Bowdoin a vital, growing educational \\nforce for future generations of students and faculty.\\nFinally, Bowdoin’s intellectual mission is informed by the humbling and cautionary lesson of the \\ntwentieth century: that intellect and cultivation, unless informed by a basic sense of decency, of \\ntolerance and mercy, are ultimately destructive of both the person and society. The purpose of a \\nBowdoin education—the mission of the College—is therefore to assist a student to deepen and \\nbroaden intellectual capacities that are also attributes of maturity and wisdom: self-knowledge, \\nintellectual honesty, clarity of thought, depth of knowledge, an independent capacity to learn, \\nmental courage, self-discipline, tolerance of and interest in differences of culture and belief, and a \\nwillingness to serve the common good and subordinate self to higher goals.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cThe Curriculum\\n\\nBowdoin offers a course of study leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. Bowdoin students \\nmust design an education in the context of their own developing goals and aspirations \\nand in relation to the College’s vision of a liberal education, its distribution and division \\nrequirements, and the requirements of a major field of study. The College requires students to \\nseek breadth in their education through a set of distribution and division requirements that \\nstimulate students to navigate the curriculum in ways that encourage exploration and broaden \\nstudents’ capacities to view and interpret the world from a variety of perspectives.\\nTo graduate, a student must also complete an approved major. The major program challenges \\nstudents to develop a deeper understanding and self-assurance as independent and creative \\ncontributors to an area of study. Students choose a major, using the departmental, coordinate, \\nor interdisciplinary approaches available at Bowdoin, as a way to engage a discipline in depth.\\nThe College’s curriculum introduces students to academic disciplines that bring conceptual \\nand methodological traditions to bear in teaching disciplined inquiry, analysis, argument, \\nand understanding. Throughout their four years, students build intellectual capabilities, \\nself-confidence as independent thinkers and problem-solvers, and come to know the pleasures \\nof discovering and developing proficiencies in new areas of knowledge. A liberal education \\nfounded in both breadth and depth teaches students how to continue learning as the world \\nchanges and demands new perspectives, knowledge, and skills.\\nDesigning an education is an education in itself. The most fulfilling liberal arts education \\ncannot be fully planned before the first day of class because such mapping would not permit \\nthe many new paths for exploration that students discover as they learn about unfamiliar fields, \\nfind exciting questions and ideas, and uncover unanticipated interests and talents. Nor can a \\nchallenging education emerge if a student selects courses one by one each semester; a liberal \\neducation is much more than the sum of thirty-two credits. Bowdoin College permits a wide \\nset of choices to enable students to broaden their views of the world and of their own talents \\nand interests, and to deepen their knowledge and capacities. Designing an education thus \\nrequires self-examination, careful thought, substantial flexibility, some intellectual daring, and \\nthe wise counsel of academic advisors.\\nA vital part of the educational experience takes place in the interaction between students and \\ntheir academic advisors. Each student is assigned a pre-major academic advisor at the start of \\nthe first year. The pre-major academic advising system is intended to help students take full \\nadvantage of the first two years at Bowdoin and begin to plan the remaining years.\\nIt provides a framework within which a student can work with a faculty member to make \\ninformed academic decisions. Such a partnership is particularly important during the period of \\ntransition and adjustment that typically takes place during the first year in college. Academic \\nadvisors may make recommendations about courses, combinations of courses, or direct \\nstudents toward other resources of the College. They may also play a role at moments of \\nacademic difficulty. The effectiveness of the system depends on the commitment of the student \\nand the advisor. Students must declare their majors in the fourth semester of their college \\nenrollment and afterwards are advised by members of their major departments.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cThe Curriculum\\n\\nAcademic Requirements for the Degree\\n\\nTo qualify for the bachelor of arts degree, a student must have: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nsuccessfully passed thirty-two full-credit courses (or the equivalent);\\nspent four semesters (successfully passed sixteen credits) in residence, at least two \\nsemesters of which have been during the junior and senior years;\\ncompleted a first-year seminar; this should normally be completed by the end of the \\nfirst semester and must be completed by the end of the second semester in college;\\ncompleted at least one full-credit course (or the equivalent) in each of the \\nfollowing five distribution areas—mathematical, computational, or statistical \\nreasoning; inquiry in the natural sciences; exploring social differences; international \\nperspectives; and visual and performing arts; these should normally be completed by \\nthe end of the fourth semester in college (the end of the student’s sophomore year);\\ncompleted at least one full-credit course (or the equivalent) in each of the following \\nthree divisions of the curriculum—natural science and mathematics, social and \\nbehavioral sciences, and humanities (in addition to the required course in the visual \\nand performing arts); and\\ncompleted an approved major.\\n\\nNo student will ordinarily be permitted to remain at Bowdoin for more than nine semesters of \\nfull-time work.\\n\\nDistribution Requirements\\n\\nStudents must take at least one full-credit course (or the equivalent) for a letter grade (unless \\nthe course is only graded Credit/D/Fail, i.e., some courses in theater and dance and music) in \\neach of the following five distribution areas:\\n\\n•  Mathematical, Computational, or Statistical Reasoning (MCSR). These courses \\n\\nenable students to use mathematics and quantitative models and techniques \\nto understand the world around them either by learning the general tools of \\nmathematics and statistics or by applying them in a subject area.\\nInquiry in the Natural Sciences (INS). These courses help students expand their \\nunderstanding of the natural sciences through practices associated with questioning, \\nmeasuring, modeling, and explaining the natural world.\\nExploring Social Difference (ESD). These courses develop awareness and critical \\nunderstanding of differences in human societies (such as class, environmental \\nresources, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation). ESD courses \\nbuild the analytic skills to examine differences within a society and the ways they are \\nreflected in and shaped by historical, cultural, social, political, economic, and  \\nother processes.\\nInternational Perspectives (IP). These courses assist students in developing a \\ncritical understanding of the world beyond the United States. IP courses provide \\nstudents with the tools necessary to analyze non-US cultures, societies, and states \\n(including indigenous societies and sovereign nations within the United States and \\nits territories), either modern or historical.\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cThe Curriculum\\n\\n•  Visual and Performing Arts (VPA). These courses help students expand their \\n\\nunderstanding of artistic expression and judgment through creation, performance, and \\nanalysis of artistic work in the areas of dance, film, music, theater, and visual art.\\n\\nFirst-year seminars, independent study courses, and honors projects do not fulfill any of the \\nfive Distribution Requirements. Further, these requirements may not be met by Advanced \\nPlacement or International Baccalaureate credits and may only be satisfied with courses taken \\nat Bowdoin. These requirements should be completed by the end of the student’s fourth \\nsemester in college. A course will be counted as meeting a Distribution Requirement if a \\nstudent earns a grade of D or better; courses will only be counted if they are taken for a letter \\ngrade, though courses will count if they are required to be taken for a Credit/D/Fail grade. \\nStudents may not count the same course toward more than one Distribution Requirement. \\nAlso note that the requirement of completing a first-year seminar will only be met if the \\nseminar is taken for regular letter grades.\\n\\nDivision Requirements\\n\\nStudents must take at least one full-credit course (or the equivalent) from each of the following \\nthree divisions of the curriculum:\\n\\n•  Natural Science and Mathematics\\n• \\n•  Humanities\\n\\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\\n\\nLike the Distribution Requirements, Division Requirements may not be met by Advanced \\nPlacement or International Baccalaureate credits and may only be satisfied with courses \\ntaken at Bowdoin. A course will be counted as meeting a Division Requirement if a student \\nearns a grade of D or better; courses will only be counted if they are taken for a letter grade, \\nthough courses will count if they are required to be taken for a Credit/D/Fail grade. With \\none exception, students may count the same course to meet a division and a distribution \\nrequirement. The exception is a course that is designated to meet the humanities division \\nrequirement and the visual and performing arts distribution requirement; students may not \\ncount such a course to meet both requirements.\\n\\nThe Major Programs\\n\\nStudents may choose one of six basic patterns to satisfy the major requirement at Bowdoin: \\na departmental major, two departmental majors (a double major), a coordinate major, an \\ninterdisciplinary major, a student-designed major, or any of the preceding with a departmental \\nminor. The requirements for completing specific majors and minors in each department are \\npresented in detail in the section beginning on page 46. Interdisciplinary majors are described \\nbeginning on page 89. In certain majors, students declare a concentration, which is a focused \\ncourse of study within a broader major.\\nStudents should have ample time to be exposed to a broad range of courses and experiences \\nbefore focusing their educational interests and so do not declare their majors until the fourth \\nsemester of their college enrollment. Normally, students are required to declare their majors \\nbefore registering for courses for the junior year or applying to participate in junior- or \\nsenior-year off-campus study programs. Students declare their majors only after consultation \\nwith a major academic advisor(s). Since some departments have courses that must be passed or \\ncriteria that must be met before a student will be accepted as a major, students are encouraged \\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cThe Curriculum\\n\\nto think well in advance about possible majors and to speak with faculty about their \\neducational interests. Students may change their majors after consultation with the relevant \\ndepartments, but they may not declare a new major after the first semester of the senior year. \\nSpecial procedures exist for student-designed majors. These are described below.\\n\\nDepartmental and Program Majors\\nDepartmental and program majors are offered in the following areas:\\nAfricana Studies \\nAnthropology \\nArt History \\nAsian Studies \\nBiochemistry \\nBiology \\nChemistry \\nClassics\\nComputer Science\\n \\n \\nEarth and Oceanographic Science \\n \\n \\nEconomics\\n \\nEnglish \\nFrancophone Studies\\n \\nGender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies \\n \\nGerman\\nGovernment and Legal Studies\\n\\nHispanic Studies \\nHistory\\nItalian Studies\\nLatin American Studies \\nMathematics\\nMusic \\nNeuroscience \\nPerformance Arts \\nPhilosophy \\nPhysics \\nPsychology \\nReligion\\nRomance Languages and Literatures \\nRussian\\nSociology \\nVisual Arts\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nA student may choose to satisfy the requirements of one department or program (single major) \\nor to satisfy all of the requirements set by two departments or programs (double major). A \\nstudent who chooses a double major may drop one major at any time.\\n\\nCoordinate Major\\nThe coordinate major encourages specialization in an area of learning within the framework \\nof a recognized academic discipline. Coordinate majors are offered in education and \\nenvironmental studies. For a specific description of these majors, see pages 74 and 79.\\n\\nInterdisciplinary Major\\nInterdisciplinary majors are designed to tie together the offerings and major requirements of \\ntwo separate departments by focusing on a theme that integrates the two areas. Such majors \\nusually fulfill most or all of the requirements of two separate departments and usually entail a \\nspecial project to achieve a synthesis of the disciplines involved.\\nAnticipating that many students will be interested in certain patterns of interdisciplinary \\nstudies, several departments have specified standard requirements for interdisciplinary majors. \\nThese are:\\nEnglish and Theater\\nArt History and Archaeology\\nMathematics and Economics \\nArt History and Visual Arts\\nMathematics and Education\\nChemical Physics\\nPhysics and Education\\nComputer Science and Mathematics\\nFor complete descriptions of these interdisciplinary majors, see pages 89–97. \\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cThe Curriculum\\n\\nStudent-Designed Major\\nSome students may wish to pursue a major program that does not fit the pattern of a \\ndepartmental major, a coordinate major, or an interdisciplinary major. In such cases, a student \\nmay work with two faculty members to develop a major program that demonstrates significant \\nstrength in at least two departments. Such strength is to be shown in both the number and \\npattern of courses involved. A synthesizing project is required. Guidelines for the development \\nof student-designed majors are available from the Office of the Registrar. Student-designed \\nmajors require the approval of the Curriculum Implementation Committee. Students must \\nsubmit their proposals to the Curriculum Implementation Committee by December 1 of their \\nsophomore year.\\n\\nThe Minor\\nMost departments and programs offer one or more minor programs consisting of no fewer \\nthan four courses and no more than seven courses, including all prerequisites. A minor \\nprogram must be planned with the student’s minor department no later than the end of the \\nfirst semester of the senior year. A minor may be dropped at any time.\\n\\nThe following departments and programs offer a minor:\\nAfricana Studies \\nAnthropology\\nArt (Art History or Visual Arts)\\nAsian Studies (Asian Studies, Chinese,  \\n  or Japanese)\\nBiology \\nChemistry \\nCinema Studies*\\nClassics (Archaeology, Classical Studies,  \\n  Classics, Greek, or Latin)\\nComputer Science \\nDance\\nEarth and Oceanographic Science \\nEconomics (Economics or Economics  \\n  and Finance)\\nEducation \\nEnglish\\nEnvironmental Studies\\n\\nGender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies \\nGerman\\nGovernment and Legal Studies \\nHistory\\nLatin American Studies \\nMathematics\\nMusic (Music or Music Performance) \\nPhilosophy\\nPhysics \\nPsychology \\nReligion\\nRomance Languages and Literatures \\n(Francophone Studies, Hispanic Studies,  \\n  or Italian Studies)\\nRussian \\nSociology \\nTheater \\n\\n \\n\\n* This program only offers a minor.\\n\\n \\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nInformation about Courses\\n\\nCourse Credit\\nMost Bowdoin courses earn one full credit, which is equal to four semester hours, and \\nare considered to have equal weight toward degree requirements. A few courses, such as \\nmusic performance courses, generally earn one-half credit each. In accordance with federal \\nregulations, Bowdoin courses that count for one credit typically meet for three hours a week, \\nwith the expectation that a minimum of nine additional hours a week will be spent in lab, \\ndiscussion group, film viewings, or preparatory work.\\n\\nCourse Load\\nAll students at Bowdoin are full-time students and, in order to make normal progress toward \\nthe degree, are expected to register for no fewer than four credits each semester. Students \\nmay not take fewer than three credits per semester without approval from the Recording \\nCommittee; first-year students may not take fewer than four credits per semester without the \\napproval of both their academic advisor and the dean of first-year students. Students may not \\ntake more than five credits without approval from their academic advisor(s) and dean. Students \\nmay not take more than four credits while on academic probation without approval from \\nthe Recording Committee. Seniors may be required to take one course per semester in their \\nmajor department, at the department’s discretion. Students should note that if they choose to \\ntake three courses, they may not elect Credit/D/Fail for any of them, as per the Credit/D/Fail \\npolicy (see page 29). Taking courses Credit/D/Fail may impact a student’s ability to qualify for \\nawards such as the Sarah and James Bowdoin Scholars (see page 31). Bowdoin College also \\nadmits a small number of special students each year. These students may follow alternative \\npolicies guiding course load and other rules. Please contact the Office of Admissions or the \\nOffice of the Registrar for more information.\\nNo extra tuition charge is levied upon students who register for more than four credits, and, by \\nthe same token, no reduction in tuition is granted to students who choose to register for fewer \\nthan four credits during any of their eight semesters at Bowdoin. A student may be granted \\na tuition reduction for taking fewer than three credits only if a ninth semester is required to \\ncomplete the degree and they have previously been a full-time Bowdoin student for eight \\nsemesters. All such appeals should be made in writing to the dean of student affairs and the \\nhead of finance and administration.\\n\\nAttendance and Examinations\\nStudents are expected to attend the first meeting of any course in which they are registered. \\nStudents who do not attend the first meeting may be dropped from the course at the discretion \\nof the instructor, but only if the course was officially full before the first day of the semester.\\nRegular attendance at classes is expected and individual instructors may establish specific \\nattendance expectations. At the beginning of each semester, instructors will make clear to \\nstudents the attendance regulations of each course. If expectations are unclear, students should \\nseek clarification from their instructors.\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nAttendance at examinations is mandatory. An absence from any examination, be it an hour \\nexamination or a final examination, may result in a grade of F. In the event of illness or other \\nunavoidable cause of absence from examinations, instructors may require documentation of \\nexcuses from the Office of the Dean of Students after consultation with the Health Center \\nor the Counseling Service. Students bear ultimate responsibility for arranging make-up or \\nsubstitute course work. In unusual cases (family and personal emergencies, illness, etc.), \\nexaminations may be rescheduled by agreement of the course instructor and a dean.\\nFinal examinations of the College are held at the close of each semester and must be given \\naccording to the schedule determined each semester by the Office of the Registrar. Extra classes \\nmay only be scheduled during Reading Period with permission from the dean for academic \\naffairs. All testing activity is prohibited during Reading Period including but not limited to \\ntake-home exams, final exams, and hour exams. \\nAll academic work, except for final examinations, final papers, final lab reports, and final \\nprojects, is due on or before the last day of classes; although instructors may set earlier \\ndeadlines, they may not set later deadlines. All final academic work, including final \\nexaminations, final papers, final lab reports, and final projects, is due at or before 5:00 p.m. on \\nthe last day of the final examination period; although instructors may set earlier deadlines, they \\nmay not set later deadlines. In all cases, students should consult their course syllabi for specific \\ndeadlines for specific courses. The deadline for submitting final, approved honors projects for \\nthe Library is determined by the College.\\nAthletics and other extracurricular activities do not exempt students from the normal policies \\ngoverning attendance at classes and examinations. When conflicts arise, students should \\nimmediately discuss possible alternatives with course instructors. At times, however, students \\nmay find themselves having to make serious choices about educational priorities.\\nA student with three one-hour examinations in one day or three final examinations in two days \\nmay reschedule one for a day mutually agreeable to the student and the instructor. To initiate \\nthis change during final exams only, students must obtain an Examination Rescheduling Form \\nfrom the Office of the Registrar at least two weeks in advance of the conflicting exams. For \\nexaminations taking place during the semester, students should make arrangements directly \\nwith the faculty members. Other changes may be made for emergencies or for educational \\ndesirability, but only with the approval of the Office of the Dean of Students.\\nIn recognition of Bowdoin’s commitment to a diverse and inclusive student body and the \\nvariety of religions observed and practiced by our students, faculty are encouraged to avoid \\nconflicts between in-class examinations and other significant academic work and major \\nreligious holidays. The calendar below was developed in collaboration with the director of \\nreligious and spiritual life and includes major observances of the officially recognized religious \\ngroups at Bowdoin.\\nStudents are expected to declare their intention to observe religious holidays at the beginning \\nof the semester, and to work with an instructor when there is a conflict with a scheduled \\nexamination, paper, or project due date and a significant religious holiday observed by the \\nstudent so that, when warranted, alternative arrangements for completing the work may be \\nmade.\\nStudents or faculty who have any questions regarding how best to balance the academic \\ncalendar alongside religious observances are encouraged to consult with the director of \\nreligious and spiritual life.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\n2018–2019\\nAugust 21–22, Tues.–Wed.  \\nSeptember 9–11, Sun.–Tues. \\n \\n \\nSeptember 18–19, Tues.–Wed. \\n \\n \\nApril 19, Friday \\nApril 19–27, Fri.–Sat. \\n \\nApril 21, Sunday \\nMay 6, Wednesday \\n \\n\\nEid al-Adha, begins at sundown\\nRosh Hashanah, begins at sundown on  \\n \\nSeptember 9 and concludes at sundown on   \\nSeptember 11\\nYom Kippur, begins at sundown on  \\n \\nSeptember 18 and concludes at sundown on  \\nSeptember 19\\nGood Friday\\nPassover, begins at sundown on April 19 and  \\nconcludes at sundown on April 27\\nEaster\\nRamadan, begins at first light on May 6 and  \\nconcludes at last light on June 5\\n\\nCourse Registration and Course Changes\\nStudents register for courses each semester by obtaining their academic advisor’s approval \\nof their course requests and submitting them by the deadline specified by the Office of the \\nRegistrar. An advisor’s release of the “Advisor Hold” in Polaris indicates that the advisor and \\nstudent have discussed the student’s course selections. Since most courses have maximum and \\nminimum registration limits as well as registration priorities, students cannot assume they \\nwill be registered for their top-choice courses. Consequently, students should participate in all \\navailable “rounds” of registration to have their alternate course choices considered and to make \\nadjustments to their schedules. For more information on advising, please see bowdoin.edu/ \\nstudentaffairs/student-handbook/academic-program-and-advising.\\nRegistration for continuing students occurs at the end of the prior semester, generally about \\nsix weeks before final examinations. Registration for first-year and transfer students occurs \\nduring orientation. Students who are studying away are strongly encouraged to register at the \\nsame time as students who are on campus; the Office of the Registrar provides registration \\ninstructions and information at bowdoin.edu/registrar and sends registration instructions \\nto students at their Bowdoin email addresses. Registration in courses is complete only when \\nstudents submit the Enrollment Form, which must be submitted by the end of the first week \\nof classes. This form verifies that a student is on campus and attending classes. A student \\nwho does not submit the Enrollment Form may be removed from all classes and barred from \\nusing many of the services of the College including but not limited to, dining services, library \\nservices, and fitness services. Enrollment Forms submitted late are subject to a $50 fine. Any \\nstudent who registers initially for courses after the first week of classes must pay a $50 late fee.\\nStudents may adjust their course schedules by participating in the course add/drop process. \\nInstructions for this process are provided by the Office of the Registrar. An instructor will \\nallow a student to add a course if the following three conditions have been met: (1) the student \\nhas the necessary qualifications, including but not limited to the course prerequisites; (2) \\nthe student and instructor have agreed on how missed class material and assignments will be \\nmanaged; (3) there is room in the course or the instructor may choose to override the class \\nenrollment limit and allow additional students to register. Normally, no course may be added \\nafter the second week of classes. Students may drop courses without permission during the first \\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\ntwo weeks of the semester. Students in their first semester at Bowdoin may drop courses in the \\nthird through the sixth weeks with the permission of their dean and advisor. Students in their \\nsecond semester or later may drop a total of two courses in their Bowdoin career during weeks \\nthree through six of a semester with the permission of their academic advisor. This is a serious \\ndecision that can impact the completion of a student’s education and should only be made in \\nextenuating circumstances. If a student has previously dropped two courses after the second \\nweek of the semester in their second semester or beyond, the student will need to petition \\nthe Recording Committee for subsequent requests to drop a course during that period. At \\nno time may a student drop below three courses during any semester without permission \\nfrom the Recording Committee. Any student who wants to add a course after the two-week \\ndeadline must also petition the Recording Committee. Generally, petitions are only approved \\nif the student can show extreme personal or medical reasons for the lateness of the change. \\nAny course dropped between the first week and end of the sixth week of the semester through \\nExtended Drop will not appear on a student’s transcript; anything dropped by the Recording \\nCommittee will appear on the transcript with a grade of W (for Withdrew). In order to add \\na course late, a student must have been attending the course from the very beginning of the \\nsemester and have instructor permission. Documentation may be required. Course changes \\napproved by the Recording Committee will require payment of a $50 late fee per change, \\nunless the change is made for reasons outside the control of the student.\\nStudents will not receive a grade for a course unless they have completed all steps to register \\nfor or add the course. Also, students will receive a failing grade for a course they stop attending \\nunless all steps to drop the course have been completed before the deadline. Students are \\nexpected to monitor their records in Polaris (polaris.bowdoin.edu), the College’s student \\ninformation system; this includes monitoring the courses for which they are registered. \\nStudents bear ultimate responsibility for completing the processes that provide the College \\nwith an accurate record of their course schedule.\\nAuditing courses is a privilege extended to students, employees of the College, and community \\nmembers. Auditors must obtain permission from the course instructor before attending the \\nfirst class and follow their guidelines regarding in-class participation. Auditors are generally not \\npermitted in full courses and are not allowed to attend first-year seminars. The College reserves \\nthe right to restrict the number of courses audited by any one person and to limit the total \\nnumber of auditors on campus at any particular time. Transcripts are not offered for audited \\ncourses.\\n\\nIndependent Study\\nWith approval of a project director, normally a faculty member, a student may elect a course of \\nindependent study for which regular course credit will be given. A department will ordinarily \\napprove one or two semesters of independent study. Where more than one semester’s credit is \\nsought for a project, the project will be subject to review by the department at the end of the \\nfirst semester. In special cases that have the support of the department, credit may be extended \\nfor additional semester courses beyond two.\\nThere are normally two levels of independent study and each should be registered for using \\na paper registration form under the appropriate course number. A directed reading course \\ndesigned to allow a student to explore a subject not currently offered within the curriculum \\nshall be numbered 2970–2998. An independent study that will culminate in substantial and \\noriginal research or in a fine arts, music, or creative writing project shall be numbered 4000– \\n4028. If a student, in consultation with a department, intends to pursue honors, the student \\ncan register for an appropriate honors project course number, 4050–4079. If a department \\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\ndetermines that a project does not meet the standards for honors, the course number(s) for \\none or two semesters of independent study will be changed to 4000–4028. Collaborative \\nstudies allow students to work in small groups guided by a member of the faculty. Intermediate \\ncollaborative studies are numbered 2999; advanced collaborative studies are numbered 4029. \\nIndependent and collaborative studies may not be taken on a Credit/D/Fail basis.\\nIn independent study and honors courses that will continue beyond one semester, instructors \\nhave the option of submitting at the end of each semester, except the last, a grade of S (for \\nSatisfactory) in place of a regular letter grade. An S grade must be converted to a regular letter \\ngrade by the end of the subsequent term. All independent study grades must be regular letter \\ngrades by the end of the project’s final semester.\\n\\nCourse Grades\\nCourse grades are defined as follows:\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nA, the student has mastered the material of the course and has demonstrated \\nexceptional critical skills and originality;\\nB, the student has demonstrated a thorough and above average understanding of the \\nmaterial of the course;\\n\\n•  C, the student has demonstrated a thorough and satisfactory understanding of the \\n\\nmaterial of the course;\\n\\n•  D, the student has demonstrated a marginally satisfactory understanding of the \\nbasic material of the course (only a limited number of D grades may be counted \\ntoward the requirements for graduation); and\\nF, the student has not demonstrated a satisfactory understanding of the basic \\nmaterial of the course.\\nPlus (+) or minus (–) modifiers may be added to B and C grades; only the minus (–) \\nmodifier may be added to the A grade.\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nCourses that are dropped through the Recording Committee will be indicated with a W (for \\nWithdrew) on the student’s transcript.\\nFaculty report grades to the Office of the Registrar at the close of the semester. Each student \\nin each course must be given a grade by the grade submission deadline as established by the \\nregistrar. Grade reports are available to students in Polaris shortly after the grade submission \\ndeadline.\\nOnce reported, no grade is changed (with the exception of clerical errors) without the approval \\nof the Recording Committee. Recorded grades cannot be changed on the basis of additional \\nstudent work without approval of the Recording Committee. If students are dissatisfied with a \\ngrade received in a course, they should discuss the problem with the instructor. If the problem \\ncannot be resolved in this manner, the student should consult with the chair of the department \\nand, if necessary, with an associate dean in the Office of the Dean for Academic Affairs who \\nwill consult with the department as needed. The student may request a final review of the \\ngrade by the Recording Committee.\\nMost departments will not accept as prerequisites, or as satisfying the requirements of the \\nmajor, courses for which a grade of D has been given. Questions should be referred directly \\nto the department chair. Students who receive a grade of D or F in a course may retake the \\ncourse. Both courses and both grades will appear on the transcript, but only one course credit \\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nwill be given for successful completion of a given course. For grades recorded prior to Fall \\n2013, only the first grade earned in a repeated course is counted in a student’s GPA; beginning \\nwith grades recorded for Fall 2013, all grades earned in repeated courses are counted in a \\nstudent’s GPA. Bowdoin does not round up semester or cumulative GPAs. Instead, GPAs are \\ntruncated to display the first three decimals.\\n\\nCredit/D/Fail Option\\nA student may choose to take a limited number of courses with the Credit/D/Fail grading \\noption, as opposed to earning regular letter grades. A course may be changed from letter grades \\nto Credit/D/Fail or vice versa up until the end of the sixth week of classes using the process \\nestablished by the Office of the Registrar. When a student chooses the Credit/D/Fail grading \\noption, a grade of CR (Credit) is given if the student produces work at a level of C- or above, \\na grade of D is given if the student produces work at a D level, and a grade of F is given \\notherwise.\\nIn any given semester, a student must be registered for a minimum of 4.0 total credits to \\nelect the Credit/D/Fail grading option for a course. A student who has 5.0 or more credits in \\ntheir semester course load may elect to take an additional course on a Credit/D/Fail basis. A \\nstudent may elect the Credit/D/Fail grading option for up to four courses within the 32 credits \\nrequired for graduation; courses in excess of the 32 credits required may be taken Credit/D/ \\nFail beginning with the semester following the one in which the 32 credits are completed and \\nas long as the semester course load totals 4.0 credits or more. No more than two courses per \\nsemester can be taken Credit/D/Fail after the required 32 credits are earned. Courses that are \\nonly graded Credit/D/Fail (music ensemble and dance and theater performance courses, as \\nexamples) are not counted within these restrictions. Please note that taking courses Credit/D/ \\nFail may impact eligibility for the Sarah and James Bowdoin Scholar award.\\nMost departments and programs require that all courses taken to satisfy requirements for \\nthe major or minor be taken for regular letter grades. Courses taken to satisfy the College’s \\nfirst-year seminar requirement must be graded with regular letter grades, and courses satisfying \\ndistribution and division requirements must also be taken for regular letter grades (unless CR, \\nD, and F are the only grades given for the course). An independent study, collaborative study, \\nor honors project must be graded with regular letter grades.\\nA grade of CR (Credit) will not count toward a student’s GPA. A grade of D or F received on \\nthe Credit/D/Fail grading scale will count toward a student’s GPA, and it will count toward \\nacademic standing (probation, suspension, and dismissal).\\n\\nIncompletes\\nThe College expects students to complete all course requirements as established by instructors. \\nIn unavoidable circumstances (personal illness, family emergency, etc.) and with approval of \\nthe dean of students and the instructor, a grade of INC (Incomplete) may be recorded.\\nAn Incomplete represents a formal agreement among the instructor, a dean, and the student \\nfor the submission of unfinished course work under prescribed conditions. Students must \\ninitiate their request for an Incomplete on or before the final day of classes by contacting a \\ndean. If the Incomplete Agreement Form has not been approved and received in the Office of \\nthe Registrar by the grade submission deadline and no other grade has been assigned, a grade \\nof F will be recorded. If the Incomplete Agreement Form has been approved and signed by all \\nnecessary individuals, a date is set by which time all unfinished work must be submitted. In \\nall cases, students are expected to finish outstanding course work in a period of time roughly \\nequivalent to the period of distraction from their academic commitments. In no case will this \\n29\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nperiod of time extend beyond the end of the second week of classes of the following semester.\\nThe instructor should submit a final grade within two weeks of this date. If the agreed-upon \\nwork is not completed within the specified time limit, the Office of the Registrar will change \\nthe Incomplete to Fail or ask the instructor to give a grade based on work already completed. \\nExtensions must be approved by the dean of student affairs. Any exceptions to these rules may \\nrequire approval of the Recording Committee. \\n\\nComment and Failure Cards\\nFaculty communicate the progress of students in their classes periodically through Comment \\nCards. These written observations alert students, academic advisors, athletic coaches, and \\nthe deans in the Office of the Dean of Students to potential problems confronting students. \\nThey can also be used by faculty to highlight improvement or successes. Students should \\nview Comment Cards as academic progress reports providing warnings or highlighting \\nachievements. When a Comment Card provides a warning, the student should immediately \\nseek out their instructor to discuss strategies for improvement. Academic advisors and deans \\ncan also be very helpful in developing strategies for improvement and identifying existing \\nsupport services and resources, but it is the student’s responsibility to seek out each of these \\npeople. Not all course instructors utilize Comment Cards, so students should not rely on this \\nform of communication as their only source of feedback regarding their progress or standing in \\na course.\\nAt the end of each semester, instructors issue Failure Cards to students who fail courses. These \\nnotations provide precise reasons for a student’s failing grades. Students and academic advisors \\ngenerally find these comments instructive as they plan future course work.\\n\\nTranscripts\\nThe Office of the Registrar will furnish official transcripts upon receipt of a request through \\nthe National Student Clearinghouse that includes the student’s signature. There is no charge \\nfor transcripts unless it is requested that materials be sent by an overnight delivery service. \\nCurrent students may access their unofficial academic history via Polaris. \\n\\nStatement of Student Responsibility\\nThe College’s Academic Handbook: Policies and Procedures is available online to every Bowdoin \\nstudent at bowdoin.edu/academic-handbook. Also, students have access to their academic \\nrecords on Polaris, the College’s student information system. In all cases, the student bears \\nultimate responsibility for reading and following the academic policies and regulations of the \\nCollege and for notifying the Office of the Registrar of any problems in their records.\\n\\nThe Award of Honors\\n\\nGeneral Honors\\nGeneral honors (or Latin honors) are awarded with the degree on the basis of an average of all \\ngrades earned at Bowdoin, with a minimum of sixteen credits required for the computation. \\nTo compute the average, an A is assigned four points; a B, three points; a C, two points; a D, \\none point; and an F, zero points. Plus (+) or minus (–) modifiers add or subtract three-tenths \\nof a point (0.3). Half-credit courses are weighted as one-half course. Credit grades (CR) are \\nomitted from the computation, but a D or F grade received in a course taken on a Credit/D/ \\nFail basis does count. In the case of a course taken at Bowdoin one or more times prior to\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nFall 2013, only the first grade is included; beginning with grades recorded for Fall 2013, all \\ngrades earned in repeated courses are included. The resulting grade point average (GPA) is \\nnot rounded but truncated to display the first three decimals. A degree summa cum laude is \\nawarded to the top 2 percent of the graduating class as calculated by GPA; a degree magna \\ncum laude is awarded to the top 8 percent of the graduating class as calculated by GPA; and \\na degree cum laude is awarded to the top 20 percent of the graduating class as calculated by \\nGPA. It is Bowdoin’s policy not to disclose the GPA ranges that determine Latin Honors as \\nthey shift with each class.\\n\\nDepartmental Honors: The Honors Project\\nThe degree with a level of honors in a major subject is awarded to students who have \\ndistinguished themselves in course work in the subject and in an honors project. The award is \\nmade by the faculty upon recommendation of the department or program.\\nThe honors project offers seniors the opportunity to engage in original work under the \\nsupervision of a faculty member in their major department or program. It allows qualified \\nseniors to build a bridge from their course work to advanced scholarship in their field of study \\nthrough original, substantial, and sustained independent research. The honors project can \\nbe the culmination of a student’s academic experience at Bowdoin and offers an unparalleled \\nchance for intellectual and personal development.\\nStudents who have attained a specified level of academic achievement in their field of study \\nby their senior year are encouraged to petition their department or program to pursue an \\nhonors project carried out under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The honors project \\nusually takes place over the course of two semesters; some departments allow single-semester \\nhonors projects. The honors project results in a written thesis and/or oral defense, artistic \\nperformance, or showing, depending on the student’s field of study. Students receive a grade \\nfor each semester’s work on the honors project and may be awarded a level of honors in their \\ndepartment or program, as distinct from general honors.\\nThe honors project process differs across departments and programs in terms of qualification \\ncriteria, requirements for completion, the level of honors awarded, and the use of honors \\nproject credits to fulfill major course requirements. Students must complete an honors \\nproject to be eligible for departmental or program honors. If a student, in consultation with \\na department, intends to pursue honors, the student will register for an appropriate honors \\nproject course number, 4050–4079. All written work accepted as fulfilling the requirements \\nfor departmental honors is to be deposited in the College Library. If students do not fulfill \\nthe requirements for completion of the honors project but carry out satisfactory work for an \\nindependent study, they will receive independent study credit for one or two semesters and the \\ncourse number will be changed to 4000–4028.\\n\\nSarah and James Bowdoin Scholars (Dean’s List)\\nSarah and James Bowdoin scholarships, carrying no stipend, are awarded in the fall on the \\nbasis of work completed the previous academic year. The award is given to the top 20 percent \\nof students, as calculated by grade point average (GPA). Eligible students are those who \\ncompleted the equivalent of eight full-credit Bowdoin courses during the academic year, six \\ncredits of which were graded with regular letter grades and seven credits of which were graded \\nwith regular letter grades or non-elective Credit/D/Fail grades. In other words, among the \\neight required full-credit courses or the equivalent, a maximum of two credits may be graded \\nCredit/D/Fail, but only one credit may be for a course(s) the student elected to take with the \\nCredit/D/Fail grading option. Grades for courses taken in excess of eight credits are included \\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nin the GPA. For further information on the College’s method for computing GPA, consult the \\nsection on General Honors on page 30.\\nA book, bearing a replica of the early College bookplate serving to distinguish the James \\nBowdoin Collection in the Library, is presented to every Sarah and James Bowdoin Scholar \\nwho has earned a GPA of 4.00.\\nStudents who receive College honors have their names sent to their hometown newspaper by \\nthe Office of Communications and Public Affairs. Students not wishing to have their names \\npublished should notify the office directly.\\nIt is Bowdoin’s policy not to disclose the GPA ranges that determine Sarah and James Bowdoin \\nScholars, as they can shift.\\n\\nDeficiency in Scholarship\\n\\nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward the degree, defined as passing the \\nequivalent of four full-credit courses each semester. Students not making normal progress may \\nbe asked to make up deficient credits in approved courses at another accredited institution \\nof higher education. In addition, students are expected to meet the College’s standards of \\nacademic performance. The Recording Committee meets twice each year to review the \\nacademic records of students who are not meeting these standards. Students are placed on \\nprobation, suspension, or dismissal according to the criteria below; students on probation \\nor suspension are not considered to be in good academic standing. In cases of repeated poor \\nperformance, a student may be dismissed from the College. In cases when a student’s academic \\nstanding changes, copies of correspondence with the student that outline the student’s \\nacademic standing are sent to the student’s parent or guardian.\\n\\nAcademic Probation\\nStudents are placed on academic probation for one semester if they:\\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nreceive one F or two Ds in any semester; or\\nreceive one D while on academic probation; or\\nreceive during their tenure at Bowdoin a total of four or five Ds or some equivalent \\ncombination of Fs and Ds where one F is equivalent to two Ds.\\n\\nNote: Under some circumstances, a student may qualify for academic suspension. See \\nAcademic Suspension.\\nAlso, students are placed on academic probation for one semester upon returning from \\nacademic suspension. Students on academic probation will be assigned to work closely \\nwith their academic advisor and a dean from the Office of the Dean of Students. Students \\nare required to enroll in four full-credit courses graded with regular letter grades while on \\nacademic probation. Students on academic probation normally are not eligible to study away.\\n\\nAcademic Suspension\\nStudents are placed on academic suspension if they:\\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nreceive two Fs, one F and two Ds, or four Ds in any semester; or\\nreceive one F or two Ds while on academic probation; or\\nreceive during their tenure at Bowdoin a total of six Ds or some equivalent \\ncombination of Fs and Ds where one F is equivalent to two Ds.\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nA student on suspension for academic deficiency normally is suspended for one year and \\nmay be asked to complete course work at another accredited four-year institution before \\nbeing readmitted. Students are expected to earn grades of C- or better in these courses. Other \\nconditions for readmission are set by the Recording Committee and stated in writing at the \\ntime of suspension. A suspended student must submit a letter requesting readmission. The \\nReadmission Committee meets to consider these requests. A student who is readmitted is \\neligible for financial aid, according to demonstrated need, as long as the student adheres to \\nthe relevant financial aid deadlines. Once the student is readmitted, the Office of the Registrar \\nwill send course and registration information to the student’s Bowdoin email address unless \\nan alternative email address has been provided. Students are ineligible for housing until after \\nthey have been readmitted, and there is no guarantee that College housing will be available at \\nthat time. While suspended, students are not permitted to visit campus without the written \\npermission of the dean of student affairs. Generally, permission to visit campus is only granted \\nfor educational or health treatment purposes. Students are unable to participate in Bowdoin \\nCollege athletic programs until they have been readmitted. Students are permitted to submit \\nan application for Off-Campus Study (normal deadlines apply); however, they are not eligible \\nto apply for resident assistant (RA), proctor, or house resident positions until readmitted.\\n\\nDismissal\\nStudents will be subject to dismissal if they:\\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nincur a second academic suspension; or\\nreceive during their tenure at Bowdoin a total of seven or eight Ds (or some \\ncombination of Fs and Ds where one F is equivalent to two Ds), after having \\npreviously been placed on academic suspension; or\\nreceive during their tenure at Bowdoin a total of nine Ds or some equivalent \\ncombination of Fs and Ds where one F is equivalent to two Ds.\\n\\nOther Academic Regulations\\n\\nPersonal Leave of Absence\\nStudents may, with the approval of a dean, and in consultation with their academic advisor, \\ninterrupt their Bowdoin education and take a voluntary personal leave of absence to pursue \\nother interests for one or two semesters. A personal leave of absence functions as a withdrawal \\nfrom the College, during which time the student is not enrolled at the College. If a student \\nintends to take a personal leave from the College, they should complete the Intent to \\nWithdraw Form, reference the Withdrawal Checklist and any other associated information, \\nand return it to the Office of the Dean of Students.\\nThe conditions governing a personal leave of absence are as follows:\\n\\n1.  Students must be in good academic and social standing at the end of the semester \\n\\nimmediately prior to the start of the leave.\\n\\n2.  Leaves typically begin at the start of a regular semester and may not extend beyond \\n\\ntwo semesters. Exceptions may be granted by the dean of students.\\n\\n3.  A personal leave may not be used in lieu of a voluntary medical leave.\\n4.  Leaves of absence, extensions, or terminations of leaves must have the approval of a \\n\\ndean.\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\n5.  Students on personal leave are not considered enrolled at Bowdoin and are expected \\nto leave the College community. Exceptions may be granted by the dean of students.\\n\\n6.  Students on leave may not transfer academic credit to Bowdoin for course work \\n\\ntaken while on leave without prior approval as set forth below.\\n\\n7.  Students should be aware that taking a leave may affect their class standing.\\n8.  Students should be aware that taking a leave may have financial implications related \\nto tuition reimbursement, financial aid, and repayment status of any student loans. \\nReturning students retain financial aid eligibility if they meet applicable deadlines.\\nStudents on leave will be able to participate in course registration for the semester in which \\nthey are expected to return. Course registration instructions will be sent to their Bowdoin \\nemail. Students returning from leave will be able to participate in the selection of housing \\nvia a proxy process and are free to visit campus occasionally without the dean’s permission \\nunless otherwise notified. While on leave, students are unable to compete in Bowdoin College \\nathletic programs until after the last day of exams prior to the semester in which they are \\nscheduled to return. Students on leave are typically permitted to submit applications for \\noff-campus study and for student leadership positions for the upcoming semester—including \\nRA, proctor, or house proctor positions—and normal deadlines apply. Students on a voluntary \\npersonal leave (and not for academic performance, disciplinary, or medical reasons) do not \\nneed to apply for readmission and are expected to return at the conclusion of their leave.\\n\\nMedical Leave of Absence\\nFor a variety of reasons, students may find it beneficial to request a leave of absence to address \\na health condition. In limited circumstances, the College may deem it necessary to require \\na student to take a medical leave of absence. The medical leave status will continue until the \\nstudent is prepared to return to the College and is readmitted by the Readmission Committee. \\nThis policy outlines the circumstances of such leaves as well as various procedures and \\nconditions, including readmission criteria and processes and implications for the student in \\nterms of academic, financial, insurance, and housing matters.\\n\\nVoluntary Medical Leave\\nA student is encouraged to request a voluntary medical leave in the event that they believe \\nthat their physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability \\nto succeed at Bowdoin and/or that the demands of college life are interfering with recovery, \\ntreatment, or safety. A student who, in consultation with either the director of health services \\nor director of counseling services, determines that they need to request a voluntary medical \\nleave should contact their dean to discuss the terms of the leave as determined by the College. \\nWhenever possible, students intending to go on a medical leave from the College should \\ncomplete the Intent to Withdraw Form, reference the Withdrawal Checklist and any other \\nassociated information, and return it to the Office of the Dean of Students.\\n\\nInvoluntary Medical Leave\\nIn unusual circumstances, the dean of students or their designee, in consultation with health \\nservices and/or counseling services professionals, may determine that a student needs to be \\nplaced on involuntary medical leave. In the event such a determination is made, the College \\nwill promptly convey that decision in writing to the student. Any student whose situation falls \\nwithin the following categories may be subject to involuntary leave of absence:\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\npresents a substantial risk of harm to self or others or is failing to carry out \\nsubstantial self-care obligations; or\\nsignificantly disrupts the educational or other activities of the College community; \\nor\\nis unable to participate meaningfully in educational activities; or\\nrequires a level of care from the College community that exceeds the resources and \\nstaffing that the College can reasonably be expected to provide for the student’s \\nwell-being.\\n\\nThe involuntary leave determination will be based upon an individualized assessment, \\nreflecting reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best \\navailable objective evidence. The decision will reflect consideration of a number of factors, \\nincluding the student’s ability to safely participate in the College’s programs, inclusive of \\nthe student’s ability to carry out substantial self-care obligations, and will examine whether \\nthe student is otherwise qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to effectively \\nparticipate in the College community. The assessment will determine the student’s impact on \\nthe campus community; the nature, duration, and severity of any risk posed; the probability \\nthat a potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, \\npractices, or procedures will sufficiently mitigate the risk. In particularly urgent situations, \\nthe College may require the student to leave campus on an interim basis while it performs the \\nassessment.\\n\\nReturn from Hospitalization\\nA student who is hospitalized as a result of a physical or mental health issue may wish to take a \\nmedical leave from Bowdoin to recover. If so, the student should follow the voluntary medical \\nleave process set forth herein. In the event the student no longer requires a hospital setting and \\ndoes not wish to take a medical leave, that student must be evaluated by Bowdoin for readiness \\nto return to campus before the student may return. Note that, in some situations, the hospital \\nmay determine that the student is eligible for discharge; however, a separate administrative \\ndecision is to be made by Bowdoin with respect to whether or not that student may return \\nto campus. It may be determined, upon such an individualized evaluation, that the student \\nhas recovered such that the student no longer requires a hospital setting but may still need \\nmore support than the student can receive in a residential college setting. In such situations, \\na required withdrawal from Bowdoin for medical reasons may be considered to allow for a \\nmore extended period of recuperation. In that situation, if the student is unwilling to take a \\nvoluntary medical leave, the involuntary medical leave process shall be followed as set forth \\nherein.\\n\\nFamily Notification\\nThe College reserves the right, consistent with applicable state and federal privacy laws, to \\nnotify a parent or guardian of their student’s status if circumstances warrant and if it is believed \\nto be in the best interest of the student and the College community.\\n\\nAppeal Procedure for Involuntary Medical Leave\\nIf a student believes that the College’s decision to place them on an involuntary medical \\nleave and/or the conditions the College may have placed upon the student’s return from an \\ninvoluntary medical leave are unreasonable or that the procedures and/or information relied \\nupon in making the decision were wrong or unfair, the student may appeal the decision. The \\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nappeal must be made in writing to the dean of student affairs. Appeals should clearly state the \\nspecific grounds for appeal and should present relevant information to support the statements \\nincluding medical/clinical evidence in support of their position. In such situations, the student \\nmay be required to sign a limited release to enable the dean of student affairs or their designee \\nto consult with the student’s health care provider on the involuntary leave decision and/or \\nconditions placed upon the student’s return. Once notified of the involuntary medical leave, \\nthe student has five (5) business days to submit their appeal. The student may not remain on \\ncampus during the appeal period. If no timely appeal is submitted, the decision about the \\ninvoluntary medical leave and any conditions imposed is final. The dean of student affairs or \\ntheir designee will respond in writing to the student’s written appeal within five (5) business \\ndays. The response will provide a conclusion as to whether or not the involuntary medical \\nleave is appropriate upon a thorough review of the relevant facts and information. The dean of \\nstudent affairs reserves the right to request an assessment by an outside medical provider of the \\nCollege’s choice and at the College’s expense when it is believed that the information available \\nto the College so warrants. In such instances, a delay in the resolution of the appeal may be \\nnecessary.\\n\\nReadmission Criteria and Procedures\\n\\nGeneral Readmission\\nA student who has been placed on a leave for academic performance, disciplinary, or medical \\nreasons—whether voluntary or involuntary—must apply for readmission before the student is \\nallowed to return to Bowdoin College.\\nThe student must send a letter to the Readmission Committee in a timely manner, to the \\nattention of the dean of students, requesting formal readmission to the College. That letter \\nmust comply with the terms of the student’s leave contained in the letter confirming the \\nstudent’s leave (which is typically from the Office of the Dean of Students or the Office of \\nthe Registrar). Once the Readmission Committee has reached a decision, the student will be \\nnotified by their dean. The decision of the committee is final.\\n\\nReadmission Following Medical Leave\\nWhere a student requests readmission following a medical leave, or where the terms of a \\nstudent’s leave otherwise require it, the student must also send to the director of health \\nservices and/or the director of counseling services and wellness programs a report from the \\nstudent’s physician and/or health care provider. The report is expected to include discussion \\nof the student’s current health status, course of treatment undergone during the leave, and \\nthe student’s compliance with any treatment plan, as well as any specific recommendations \\nfor the student and the College with respect to the student’s successful return to Bowdoin. \\nThe report will address the following: (a) the student’s readiness to return to the academic \\nand cocurricular demands of college life; (b) the student’s readiness to live on campus; (c) the \\nstudent’s ongoing treatment needs; (d) the student’s readiness to return to competitive sports, \\nif the student is a collegiate athlete; and (e) any other suggestions that the health care provider \\ndeems appropriate.\\nThe student’s health care provider submitting the report must be a licensed physician if the \\nevaluation is regarding medical conditions and must be a licensed mental health provider if \\nevaluating mental health conditions. Further, all providers must be unrelated to the student \\nand must have a specialty and credentials appropriate for the condition(s) of concern. The \\nstudent is responsible for any cost associated with the provider’s evaluation.\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nThe Readmission Committee will review the information provided by the student and evaluate \\nthe appropriateness of the student’s return. The committee may request further information \\nfrom the student’s health care providers. In order to provide for such requests, the student will \\nbe asked to sign and return a limited release form so that those individuals at the College who \\nare involved in evaluating the student’s return may consult with the student’s outside health \\ncare provider(s) limited to aiding the College in assessing the student’s readiness to return to \\ncampus life and if so, under what conditions. In addition, the director of health services and/\\nor the director of counseling services and wellness programs may also choose to meet with the \\nstudent as part of the evaluation. The College reserves the right to request an assessment by an \\noutside medical provider, of the College’s choice at the College’s expense, when it believes the \\ncircumstances so warrant.  \\nIn the event that the student is permitted to return to Bowdoin, the student will speak \\nwith their dean before returning in order to discuss the terms of the student’s readmission, \\nincluding, if appropriate, a discussion of a continuing treatment plan for the student. If such \\na plan is established, and if the student does not follow the established plan, the College will \\nhave the right to revoke its decision to readmit the student and will have the right to require \\nthe student to resume their medical leave immediately.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\nStudents should refer to the Withdrawal Checklist and other associated information to receive \\nfurther guidance on the implications of withdrawing from the College.\\n\\nAcademic Implications\\nEnrollment Status. While on leave, the student is not an enrolled student at Bowdoin College. \\nThe leave status will continue until the student returns from a personal leave or is readmitted \\nby the Readmission Committee. \\nTaking Courses at Other Institutions. The College strictly regulates the circumstances under \\nwhich students on leave may transfer credits for courses taken during their leave.  \\nIn certain circumstances, the dean of students may approve a limited course load (one or \\ntwo courses preapproved by the College). Students on a medical leave will typically not be \\npermitted to take courses during leave. If a student on a medical leave seeks approval to take \\ncourses during their leave, the student must provide support, in writing, from the student’s \\nhealth care provider. All requests for such course approval must be made in writing to the \\ndean of students. Requests for transferring course credit for more than two courses are seldom \\ngranted and require prior approval of the Recording Committee.  \\nIn instances of suspensions for disciplinary or academic reasons, the student’s suspension \\nletter will provide all pertinent details regarding course work during the suspension, including \\nwhether the student has permission to take courses, whether the student is required to take \\ncourses, and any parameters regarding when the courses may be taken, among others.  \\nIn all cases, if a student enrolls as a degree-seeking student at another institution and later \\nwishes to return to Bowdoin, they must apply through the admission process as a transfer \\nstudent.\\nOff-Campus Study Applications. Students on personal leave are permitted to submit \\napplications for off-campus study, but must comply with the deadlines for those programs. \\nQuestions should be directed to the Office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study.\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\nCourse Registration. Once a student has been readmitted to the College, they will be able \\nto participate in course registration. It is strongly advised that the student consult with their \\ncourse instructors, advisor, and dean when choosing courses following leave.\\nEducational Record Reflection. The student’s transcript will not reflect their leave. In the event \\na leave occurs after the start of the semester, courses for that semester will be listed on the \\ntranscript with grades of “W” (Withdrew). A copy of the student’s leave approval letter will \\nbe retained in the Office of the Dean of Students. The handling of the student’s educational \\nrecord is governed by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). For more \\ninformation about FERPA and a student’s rights under the law, consult Student Privacy Rights \\nPolicies in the Student Handbook.    \\n\\nFinancial Implications\\nFinancial Aid Eligibility. Any student not in attendance for one or more terms, for voluntary \\nor involuntary reasons, should be aware that their withdrawal from the College may affect \\nany financial aid they are receiving and/or any federal loans borrowed while enrolled. The \\nstudent is advised to consult with the Office of Student Aid to: 1) ensure that all aid forms \\nand required documents have been submitted prior to leaving the College; 2) review any loan \\nrepayment obligations that may come due during the leave; and 3) understand the deadlines \\nand form requirements for aid application for return to the College.\\nTuition and Fee Refunds. Tuition and fee refunds for leaves taken during the course of a \\nsemester are made in accordance with the College’s refunds policy. For more information, \\nconsult the refunds section on page 13.\\nTuition Insurance. Tuition insurance is available, but it must be purchased prior to the start of \\nthe semester. Questions should be directed to the Bursar’s Office.\\n\\nInsurance Implications\\nStudent Health Insurance. If the student is currently enrolled in the Bowdoin Student \\nAccident and Sickness Insurance Plan, their coverage will continue as specified by the plan \\npolicy. If the student waived Bowdoin’s plan, they should consult their comparable plan for \\nany exclusions or limitations. Questions should be directed to the student health insurance \\ncoordinator.\\n\\nHousing Implications \\nOn a case-by-case basis, the College, in consultation with the student’s health care providers, \\nmay determine that the returning student should not live on campus but is capable of \\nattending classes. In addition, College housing may not be available to the student upon \\ntheir return, due to space limitations. Once the student has been readmitted, they can discuss \\navailability and options with the Office of Residential Life. Students on medical leave are \\nineligible to participate in the spring housing lottery. In the event that College housing is not \\navailable, the student may choose to live in housing in the local area. The Office of Residential \\nLife maintains information on local area rental listings. Questions should be directed to the \\nOffice of Residential Life.\\n\\nPresence on Campus\\nWhile a student is on medical leave, or suspension for disciplinary or academic reasons, they \\nwill not be permitted to visit campus without prior written permission of the dean of students \\nor their designee. Permission will generally be granted for certain preapproved educational or \\nhealth treatment purposes only. \\n38\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nTransfer of Credit from Other Institutions\\nThe Bowdoin degree certifies that a student has completed a course of study that meets \\nstandards established by the faculty. It is normally expected that all of a student’s course work \\nafter matriculation will be completed either at Bowdoin or in an approved semester- or year- \\nlong off-campus study program. (More information about such programs can be found in the \\nsection on Off-Campus Study on page 45.)\\nApart from taking courses at Bowdoin or in approved off-campus study programs, the College \\nrecognizes that there may be rare occasions when it would serve a student’s educational \\ninterests to take courses elsewhere for credit toward the Bowdoin degree. In such cases, the \\nwork done elsewhere should represent a standard of achievement comparable to what is \\nexpected at Bowdoin in a field of study characteristic of the liberal arts.\\nA student may transfer a cumulative total of no more than four credits from study in summer \\nschool programs from four-year accredited colleges/universities. The College does not grant \\ncredit for work completed through two-year institutions, domestic for-profit institutions, \\ncorrespondence courses, bridge programs, or abbreviated winter terms (“Jan Plans”) or their \\nequivalent at other times of the year, or programs such as HBX CORe. The College does not \\ngrant credit for professional or vocational study at other institutions. Beginning with courses \\ntaken in the Summer 2014 term forward, students may apply for transfer credit approval for \\nonline or hybrid courses. Credit is not granted for courses taken elsewhere during the academic \\nyear except in special circumstances and with the prior approval of the Recording Committee.\\nStudents must apply to the Office of the Registrar for permission to transfer credit in advance \\nof enrollment at another institution. The Application for Transfer of Credit requires the \\napproval of the appropriate Bowdoin department chair; in order to make this determination, \\nthe department chair will need to see a course description and/or syllabus for each course.\\nIn certain cases, students may be given conditional approval and be required to submit \\nsupporting documents, including the course syllabus and all papers and exams, after the course \\nhas been completed. The College may decline to grant credit if the course or the student’s work \\nin the course does not satisfy Bowdoin academic standards. Credit is not awarded for courses \\nin which the student has earned a grade below C- or for courses not graded with regular letter \\ngrades. Students are responsible for ensuring these regulations are met.\\nNo credit will be awarded until an official transcript showing the number of credits or credit- \\nhours and the grade(s) earned has been received from the other institution. It is the student’s \\nresponsibility to ensure that the official transcript is sent directly to the Office of the Registrar, \\nand the transcript must arrive in a sealed envelope. Normally the transcript must be received \\nand permission to transfer credit secured within one year following the term in which the \\ncourse was taken. Credit may not be transferred if a longer time period has elapsed.\\nTranscripts of credit earned at other institutions that have been presented to Bowdoin College \\nfor admission or transfer of credit become part of the student’s permanent record, but are \\nnot issued, reissued, or copied for distribution. Course titles and grades for courses that were \\ntransferred from other institutions are not recorded on the Bowdoin transcript; only the \\ninstitutional name and the credit are listed.\\nStudents should be aware that credits earned elsewhere may not transfer on a one-to-one basis; \\nsome courses may be accorded less than a full Bowdoin credit. Students are advised to consult \\nwith the Office of the Registrar in advance to learn the basis on which transfer credit will be \\ndetermined. For comparison purposes, students should know that one Bowdoin course is \\ngenerally understood to be equal to four semester-hours or six quarter-hours.\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nPre-Matriculation Credit. Students may have the opportunity to enroll in college-level course \\nwork prior to matriculating at Bowdoin. Bowdoin College will consider granting credit for \\npre-matriculation course work, providing the following criteria have been met: (1) the course \\nwork must have been completed on a college campus at an accredited four-year college/ \\nuniversity in courses taught by college faculty, (2) the course work must have been completed \\nin a class with matriculated college students, (3) the courses may not have been used to satisfy \\nany high-school graduation requirements, and (4) the course work must represent a standard \\nof achievement comparable to what is expected at Bowdoin in a field of study characteristic \\nof the liberal arts. Bowdoin also recognizes Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, \\nand other international exams and may grant credit toward graduation requirements for \\nthem. Students should refer to the Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate \\nrules in effect at the time of their matriculation. Students may receive a maximum of four \\npre-matriculation credits toward the Bowdoin degree from approved exams or other approved \\ncollege/university courses.\\n\\nGraduation\\nStudents submit to the Office of the Registrar the Notice of Intent to Graduate in the fall \\nof the academic year in which they intend to graduate. This required form is considered the \\nofficial application for graduation. Submission of this form begins the final degree audit \\nprocess and ensures that students receive all notices related to Commencement. Students will \\ngenerally receive written notice by May 1 that they have been given preliminary clearance to \\ngraduate. Final clearance is determined after all academic work has been completed and final \\ngrades for the spring semester have been recorded.\\nStudents may take part in only one Commencement, and they are expected to complete all \\ndegree requirements before they participate in graduation exercises. Students with two or fewer \\ncredits remaining and who can expect to complete all requirements by the end of the following \\nAugust may be allowed to participate in Commencement but will not receive a diploma. \\nIn such cases, the degree will actually be conferred at the May Commencement following \\nthe completion of all requirements, and the diploma will be mailed to the student at that \\ntime. Speakers at Commencement and other students playing visible leadership roles in the \\nceremony must have completed all requirements for graduation.\\n\\nResignation\\nStudents may resign from Bowdoin at any time. Resignation permanently and irrevocably \\nterminates the student’s official relationship with the College. If a student were to desire at \\nsome future date to return to Bowdoin, the student would need to reapply to the College \\nthrough the regular admissions process as a transfer student. Given the permanency of \\nresignation, students are encouraged to discuss their plans thoroughly with advisors, parents, \\nand a dean. In instances where students have been away from the College for multiple \\nsemesters, including where students are not on a formal leave or where a leave period has \\nexpired, they may be administratively resigned. Furthermore, a student who enrolls in another \\ninstitution as a degree-seeking student will be administratively resigned.\\nA decision to resign should be submitted in writing using the Intent to Withdraw Form. \\nStudents should also reference the Withdrawal Checklist and any other associated information.\\nUpon resignation, tuition and fee refunds are made in accordance with the College’s refunds \\npolicy. \\n\\n40\\n\\n\\x0cAcademic Standards and Regulations\\n\\nThe Academic Handbook is current as of August 1, 2018. The Student Handbook, available at \\nbowdoin.edu/studentaffairs/student-handbook, may be updated more frequently after this date \\nand is the authoritative source for information governing student life at Bowdoin.\\n\\nThe Recording Committee and Student Petitions\\nThe Recording Committee is a standing committee of the College whose purpose is to address \\nmatters pertaining to the academic standing of individual students and to consider exceptions \\nto the policies and procedures governing academic life. The committee meets regularly to \\nconsider individual student petitions and meets at the end of each semester to review the \\nrecords of students who are subject to probation, suspension, or dismissal. Decisions of the \\ncommittee are final.\\nStudents who are seeking exceptions to academic regulations or curricular requirements \\nmust petition the Recording Committee. Petition forms may be obtained from the Office of \\nthe Dean of Students. All petitions require the signature of a dean, and, depending on the \\nnature of the request, some may require supporting documentation from a faculty member, \\ndoctor, or counselor. Students are notified of the outcome of their petitions by the secretary \\nof the Recording Committee. Students should note that any courses dropped with Recording \\nCommittee permission will result in a W (for Withdrew) being recorded on the students’ \\ntranscripts.\\n\\nThe Readmission Committee\\nThe Readmission Committee is chaired by the dean of students and comprises the dean of \\nstudents and assistant deans of students; director of student aid; director of residential life; \\na representative from the Office of Admissions; and the THRIVE program director. The \\ndirector of counseling services and wellness programs, the director of the health services, \\nand the director of student aid serve as advisors to the committee. The committee meets \\nto consider the petitions of students who are seeking to return from academic suspension, \\ndisciplinary suspension, and/or medical leave. Letters requesting readmission and supporting \\nmaterials should be directed to the dean of students office. Students on academic suspension, \\ndisciplinary suspension, and/or medical leave are not eligible to register for classes or make \\nhousing arrangements until they have been readmitted. Students seeking readmission are \\nnotified of the outcome of their petitions by their dean. \\n\\n41\\n\\n\\x0cSpecial Areas of Study\\n\\nArabic\\nStudents interested in Arabic should contact Batool Khattab, lecturer in Arabic, or Lynn \\nBrettler, academic department coordinator.\\n\\nArctic Studies\\nA focus in Arctic studies, offered through a variety of departments, including the Department \\nof Sociology and Anthropology, the Department of Earth and Oceanographic Science, the \\nEnvironmental Studies Program, the Department of Government and Legal Studies, and \\nthe Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum and Arctic Studies Center, provides students with \\nopportunities to explore artistic, cultural, social, political, and environmental issues involving \\nArctic lands, seas, and communities. Students interested in the Arctic are encouraged \\nto consult with the director of the Arctic Studies Center in order to plan an appropriate \\ninterdisciplinary program involving course work and fieldwork at Bowdoin, in study abroad \\nprograms, and in the North. Work-study and internship opportunities at the Arctic Museum \\ncomplement the academic program.\\n\\nCoastal Studies\\nThe College offers expertise in the marine sciences primarily through the biology, earth and \\noceanographic science, and environmental studies departments and programs and two unique \\nfield sites: Schiller Coastal Studies Center located on Orr’s Island in Harpswell, Maine, and \\nthe more remote Kent Island Scientific Station located in Canada’s Bay of Fundy. The College \\noffers the Bowdoin Marine Science Semester (BMSS), an immersion experience in marine \\nfieldwork, lab work, and independent research open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors from \\nBowdoin and other colleges who are interested in marine science. Students take four courses \\nsequentially in three-to-four-week modules taught at the Schiller Coastal Studies Center, \\nwhile residing on Bowdoin’s main campus. Other courses during regular semesters also take \\nadvantage of the temperate and subarctic environments of coastal Maine and the Canadian \\nMaritime provinces; contact department coordinators for details. Summer research fellowships \\nin coastal and marine studies are also available annually. Interested students should speak with \\nDavid B. Carlon, associate professor of biology and director of the Bowdoin College Schiller \\nCoastal Studies Center, or Rosemary Armstrong, coastal studies program coordinator.\\n\\nDigital and Computational Studies\\nDigital and Computational Studies (DCS) is a curricular initiative premised on the \\nrecognition that the power of computation is fundamentally changing the world. Students \\nin DCS courses, using digital and computational tools, explore methods in problem-solving \\nand creative expression across the curriculum while appreciating the historical and ethical \\nimplications of using these tools. DCS currently offers introductory courses that engage with \\ntopics such as the disruptive role of computation and digital information across disciplines, \\nthe basic elements of programming, the complex nature of data, computational thinking, and \\nthe power and privileges associated with the pervasiveness of digital culture in everyday lives. \\nDCS courses at the advanced level are cross-listed with a variety of departments where the \\nbasic critical approaches of DCS are applied within particular disciplines. DCS is coordinated \\nand supported by: Eric Chown, director and professor of computer science; Martha Janeway, \\ncoordinator; Crystal Hall, associate professor; Mohammad T. Irfan, assistant professor; and \\nFernando Nascimento, postdoctoral fellow.\\n42\\n\\n\\x0cSpecial Areas of Study\\n\\nEngineering Dual-Degree Options\\nBowdoin College arranges shared studies programs with the University of Maine College of \\nEngineering (open only to Maine residents), the School of Engineering and Applied Science of \\nColumbia University, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and the Thayer School \\nof Engineering at Dartmouth College.\\nColumbia and the University of Maine allow qualified Bowdoin students to transfer into the \\nthird year of their engineering programs after three years at Bowdoin (three years at Bowdoin \\nand two years at the other institution, called a 3-2 option). Columbia also offers a 4-2 option, \\nwhich may be of interest to some students.\\nCaltech invites highly qualified students to apply to their 3-2 program. Determination of \\nacceptance is decided by the Caltech Upperclass Admissions Committee for students to \\ntransfer upon completion of their junior year.\\nDartmouth offers a number of options, including taking the junior year at the Dartmouth \\nThayer School of Engineering, senior year at Bowdoin, and a fifth year of engineering at \\nDartmouth.\\nThe student successfully completing the Columbia, Maine, or Caltech program earns a \\nbachelor of science degree from the engineering school and a bachelor of arts degree from \\nBowdoin, both conferred at the end of their fifth year. For the Dartmouth program, the \\nengineering courses are used as transfer credits to complete the Bowdoin degree, conferred \\nafter the fourth year. The Dartmouth engineering degree is conferred upon successful \\ncompletion of a fifth year in engineering at Dartmouth.\\nOnce a student decides to pursue a dual degree, the student must receive departmental \\npermission and then meet with the associate registrar and submit a declaration of intent to \\npursue this program to the Office of the Registrar when applying to the subsequent institution.\\nFinally, students may also apply as regular transfer students into any nationally recognized \\nengineering program, earning only a degree from that engineering institution.\\nThese programs are coordinated by Corey Colwill, assistant director for the Center for \\nCo-Curricular Opportunities, with assistance from representatives from each natural science \\ndepartment, including Professor William Barker in the Department of Mathematics, Professor \\nStephen Majercik in the Department of Computer Science, and Professor Dale Syphers and \\nLaboratory Instructor Gary Miers in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Curricular \\nrequirements for engineering dual-degree options vary by program. It is important for students \\nto get advising about the program early in their career at Bowdoin to plan a course of study \\nthat will satisfy major and distribution requirements. Students interested in these programs \\nshould contact Corey Colwill.\\n\\nLegal Studies\\nStudents considering the study of law may consult with Bowdoin Career Planning. Bowdoin \\napplicants from every major and department have been successful applicants to highly \\ncompetitive law schools. Students will be provided guidance and assistance on all aspects of \\nthe application process. It is best to begin planning for law school by the beginning of the \\njunior year. Bowdoin Career Planning can introduce students to alumni attending law school \\nor practicing law. In addition, Bowdoin Career Planning has excellent written and online \\nresources about law schools and careers in the legal field. Bowdoin Career Planning also \\nsupports and assists Bowdoin alumni with the law school application process if they choose to \\napply in the years following graduation.\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0cSpecial Areas of Study\\nBowdoin participates with Columbia University in an accelerated interdisciplinary program in \\nlegal education. Under the terms of this program, Bowdoin students may apply to begin the \\nstudy of law after three years at Bowdoin. Students who successfully complete the requirements \\nfor the JD at Columbia also receive an AB from Bowdoin. Students interested in the Columbia \\nprogram should meet with Professor Allen Springer during their first year at Bowdoin to plan \\na course of study that will satisfy major and distribution requirements. In addition, the student \\nmust meet with the associate registrar once departmental permission is received and submit a \\ndeclaration of intent to pursue this program to the Office of the Registrar when applying to \\nColumbia University.\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\x0cOff-Campus Study\\n\\nSemester and Academic Year. The Office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study \\nprepares students to “be at home in all lands” through advising and programming that \\npromote intentionality and integration to broaden and enrich the Bowdoin education. \\nWhether off-campus study occurs abroad or in the United States, students are encouraged to \\nparticipate in semester-long and yearlong programs of off-campus study as an extension of the \\non-campus educational experience, and expectations are that the courses in which students \\nearn credit toward the degree be in a field of study characteristic of the liberal arts and be \\nacademically engaging and complementary to their studies at Bowdoin.\\nA student who wishes to count academic credit earned in an off-campus study program toward \\nthe Bowdoin degree is required to obtain approval, in advance, from the Office of International \\nPrograms and Off-Campus Study. If the student wishes to count credits earned in the program \\ntoward the major or minor, the approval of the major and minor department is required as well. \\nStudents contemplating off-campus study should consult the online Academics Abroad section \\non the Off-Campus Study website at bowdoin.edu/ocs; they are urged to begin planning early \\nin the academic year before that in which they hope to study away, and must complete both a \\nregistration of intent in November and a full application in February to request permission to \\nstudy away. Separately, students apply directly to the university or program they wish to attend. \\n(Application deadlines for individual programs vary considerably; it is the responsibility of the \\nstudent to determine these deadlines and ensure that they are met.) Approvals of late applications \\nto study off campus are rare and considered on a case-by-case basis. To be approved for Bowdoin \\ndegree credit, the proposed program of study away should satisfy the College’s academic \\nstandards and form an integral part of a student’s overall academic plan. Approval of individual \\nrequests may also be affected by the College’s concern to maintain a balance between the number \\nof students away during the fall and spring terms.\\nStudents are expected to carry a full course load in any off-campus study program, and \\nstudents typically study away for one or two semesters. If a student wishes to study away for \\nmore time, the student needs to petition the Recording Committee. Credit earned is not \\nformally transferred until the Office of the Registrar has received and reviewed appropriate \\ndocumentation, including the official transcript from the program. In some cases, it may be \\nrequired that the appropriate Bowdoin department review the student’s completed work.\\nBowdoin charges an off-campus study fee (see page 12). Students on aid should expect that \\ntheir family contribution toward comprehensive fees should remain the same whether they are \\non or off campus. \\nDepending on their academic needs, students normally are expected to select from the \\noptions list of approximately one hundred programs and universities kept by the Office of \\nInternational Programs and Off-Campus Study, which may be found at bowdoin.edu/ocs/ \\njourney/options-list.\\nSummer. A student may also elect to study away during the summer. To transfer credit for \\ncourses taken in a summer study-abroad program, a student must gain approval in advance by \\nsubmitting an Application for Transfer of Credit to the Office of International Programs and \\nOff-Campus Study as well as the Office of the Registrar; refer to Transfer of Credit from Other \\nInstitutions on pages 39–40. Financial aid does not transfer for summer study abroad, nor is \\nthe student considered enrolled at Bowdoin for federal reporting purposes.\\n \\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0c  Departments, Programs of Instruction, \\n\\nand Interdisciplinary Majors\\n\\nThe departments and programs of instruction in the following descriptions are listed in \\nalphabetical order.

Majors in the \\ndepartment are expected to elect one of these programs. The major in art history is devoted \\nprimarily to the historical and critical study of the visual arts as an embodiment of some \\nof humanity’s cultural values and a record of the historical interplay of sensibility, thought, \\nand society. The major in visual arts is intended to encourage a sensitive development of \\nperceptual, creative, and critical abilities in visual expression.\\n\\nArt History\\n\\nRequirements for the Major in Art History\\nThe art history major consists of ten courses, excluding first-year seminars. \\nRequired courses:\\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nArt History 1100\\none course in African, Asian, or pre-Columbian art history numbered 1103 or \\nhigher\\none course from Art History 2090 (same as Archaeology 1101), 2100 (same as \\nArchaeology 1102), 2120, 2130, 2140, 2150, 2260, or 2270\\none course from Art History 2220, 2230, 2240, or 2320\\none course from Art History 2410, 2420, 2440, 2450, 2520, 2540, 2620, or 2640\\none additional intermediate course (numbered 2000–2969)\\ntwo advanced seminars (numbered 3000–3999)\\ntwo additional art history courses numbered higher than 1100 (Only one \\nindependent study may be used to satisfy this requirement.)\\n\\nArt history majors are also encouraged to take courses in foreign languages and literature, \\nhistory, philosophy, religion, and the other arts.\\nA maximum of two courses for one semester of study from another college or university may \\ncount toward the major in art history with departmental approval of that transfer credit. If a \\nstudent studies away for a full academic year, three courses from another college or university \\nmay count toward their art history major with departmental approval.\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\x0cArt\\nStudents who received a minimum score of four on the Art History Advanced Placement exam \\nare exempt from taking Art History 1100, but they must take an additional course to replace Art \\nHistory 1100. In order to receive this placement, students must have their advanced placement \\nscores officially reported to the Office of the Registrar by the end of their sophomore year at \\nBowdoin.\\n\\nInterdisciplinary Majors\\nThe department participates in interdisciplinary programs in art history and archaeology and in \\nart history and visual arts. Art history majors may do a coordinate major with environmental \\nstudies or education.

In \\ncompleting the major, each student is required to gain a general understanding of one of \\nthese areas, acquire a working proficiency in one of the languages of South or East Asia, \\ndevelop theoretical or methodological sophistication, and demonstrate a degree of applied \\nspecialization. These principles are reflected in the requirements for an Asian studies major.\\n\\nRequirements for the Major in Asian Studies\\nStudents major in Asian studies by focusing on a particular geographic and cultural area— \\nChina, Japan, East Asia, or South Asia—or by specializing in a disciplinary subfield. Eight \\ncourses are required in addition to the study of an Asian language.\\nLanguage requirements: Two years of an East Asian language, or one year of a South Asian \\nlanguage, or the equivalent through intensive language study.\\n\\n• \\n\\nIn addition to the required two years of language study, students may apply up to \\nthree advanced intermediate (2205–2206) or advanced (3307–3308) East Asian \\nlanguage courses toward the total of eight required courses. \\n\\n•  The College does not directly offer courses in any South Asian language. \\n\\nArrangements may be made with the director of the program and the Office of \\nthe Registrar to transfer credits from another institution, or students may meet \\nthis requirement by studying Sinhala on the ISLE Program or Tamil on the SITA \\nProgram.\\n\\nArea-specific option requirements: A concentration in China, Japan, East Asia, or South \\nAsia requires eight courses, six to seven of which must focus on the geographical area of \\nspecialization, with up to two courses in an area outside that specialization.\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nStudents specializing in China must take one pre-modern course in China (2000–\\n2049) and one modern course in China (2050–2249).\\nStudents specializing in Japan must take one pre-modern course in Japan (2250–\\n2299) and one modern course in Japan (2300–2499).\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cAsian Studies\\n\\n• \\n\\nStudents focusing on South Asia must take two of the following:\\n\\no  Anthropology (1026–1038), (1550–1774), (2500–2749), or \\n\\n(2750–2969)\\n\\no  History (1026–1038), (1550–1774), (2500–2749), or (2750–2969)\\no  Religion (1026–1038), (1550–1774), (2500–2749), or (2750–2969)\\n\\nDiscipline-based option requirements: Students must consult with their advisor concerning \\ncourse selection.\\n\\n• \\n\\nAt least five courses must be in the chosen discipline: e.g., government, history, \\nliterature and visual culture (English, cinema studies, and art history), religion, or \\nany other approved discipline. One of those five courses must be an advanced course \\n(3000–4079) in the discipline of focus.\\n\\n•  Three remaining courses must explore related themes or relate to the student’s \\n\\nlanguage study. The study of an Asian language must be in one of the student’s areas \\nof study.\\n\\n•  Of the eight courses required, a maximum of three may be advanced intermediate \\n\\n(2205–2206) or advanced (3307–3308) East Asian language courses.\\n\\nAdditional notes concerning both area-specific and discipline-based options:\\n\\nA senior seminar (3000–4079) is required and must be taken at Bowdoin.\\n\\n• \\n•  One first-year seminar may count toward the major.\\n•  One course taken with the Credit/D/Fail grading option may count toward the \\nmajor as long as a CR (Credit) grade is earned and the course is not at the 3000 \\nlevel.\\nStudents must earn a grade of C- or better in order to have a course count toward \\nthe major.\\n\\n• \\n\\n•  One course is allowed to double count.\\n• \\n\\nAsian studies majors may not also minor in Chinese or Japanese language.\\n\\nRequirements for the Minor in Asian Studies\\nStudents minor in Asian studies by taking five courses.

Established programs in the People’s Republic of \\nChina, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are available for students interested in China. Students are \\nparticularly encouraged to attend the ACC, CET, and IUP programs and the Middlebury \\nProgram in Kunming. The SILS at Waseda University, IES at Nanzan University, and JCMU \\nprograms are recommended for students interested in Japan, but students may select another \\nprogram based on their academic interests. The ISLE and SITA programs are recommended \\nfor students interested in South Asia. Students should consult with the Asian studies office \\nor website and the Office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study for information \\nabout these and other programs.\\nUp to three credits from off-campus study (excluding first- and second-year language courses) \\nmay count toward the major. Up to two credits from off-campus study (excluding language \\ncourses) may count toward the minors.\\n\\n•  \\n\\nProgram Honors\\nStudents contemplating an honors project in Asian studies should have the following:\\na GPA of B+ or higher in program course offerings, or within their track of \\nconcentration;\\na clearly articulated and well-focused research topic; and\\na high measure of academic motivation and commitment.\\n\\n•  \\n•  \\n\\nAn honors project in Asian studies is a significant scholarly undertaking. It is at once an \\nopportunity and a responsibility. It allows students to conduct intensive research in an area \\nof their choosing, work closely with several faculty advisers, and contribute their voice to an \\nongoing scholarly dialogue. It takes students into the library and sometimes beyond campus in \\nsearch for materials and ideas that students make their own. It is, in many ways, what faculty \\nmembers do in their own scholarly work. \\nStudents interested in pursuing an honors project in Asian studies are highly encouraged to \\nattend the program’s honors meeting during the spring semester.\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cBiochemistry\\n\\nBiochemistry\\n\\nDanielle H.

Students pursuing these majors are encouraged to study \\nnot only the languages and literatures but also the physical monuments of Greece and Rome. \\nThis approach is reflected in the requirements for the three concentrations: courses in Greek \\nand/or Latin and in classical archaeology, history, and culture must be fulfilled.\\nThe classics program is arranged to accommodate both those students who have not studied \\nclassical languages and those who have had extensive training in Latin and Greek. The objective \\nof Greek and Latin courses is to study the ancient languages and literatures in the original. By \\ntheir very nature, these courses involve students in the politics, history, and philosophies of \\nantiquity. Advanced language courses focus on the analysis of textual material and on literary \\ncriticism.\\n\\nRequirements for the Major in Classics\\nThe classics major consists of ten courses with concentrations in three possible areas: classical \\nlanguages and literatures, classical archaeology, and classical studies.\\nClassical Language and Literatures Concentration:\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nat least six courses in Latin and/or Greek, including two at the 3300 level \\nStudents are encouraged to take courses in both languages.\\n\\no \\n\\neither Archaeology 1101 or 1102\\neither Classics 1101 or 1102\\nat least one of the following courses: Classics 1111, 1112, 2777, or 2757\\none additional course chosen from among any offered by the department, including \\nfirst-year seminars\\n\\nClassical Archaeology Concentration:\\n\\n• \\n\\nat least five courses in classical archaeology, including Archaeology 1101 and 1102 \\nand at least one 3000-level archaeology class\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cClassics\\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nfour semesters of Latin or three semesters of Greek\\nStudents in this concentration are also encouraged to take one of Classics 1111, \\n1112, 2777, or 2757.\\none additional course chosen from among any offered by the department, including \\nfirst-year seminars\\n\\nClassical Studies Concentration:\\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthree semesters of Latin or Greek\\nat least one of the following courses: Archaeology 1101 or 1102, Classics 1101 or \\n1102\\nat least one of the following courses: Classics 1111, 1112, 2777, or 2757\\nat least three 2200-level courses in classics or classical archaeology\\n\\no  There is an option to take an appropriate course in another \\n\\ndepartment—such as government, religion, or philosophy—in \\nplace of one of the three courses at the 2200 level, with department \\napproval.\\n\\nat least two courses in the department (classics, Greek, Latin, or archaeology) offered \\nat the 3300 level\\n\\nAll students in classics are required to take a research seminar (a 3000-level course designated \\nas such) in their junior or senior year, and all students must take one of their required \\n3000-level courses during their senior year.\\n\\nInterdisciplinary Major\\nThe department participates in an interdisciplinary program in archaeology and art history.

Morris†, Gonca Senel \\nVisiting Faculty: Leslie Julian Lipschitz, Ju Young Park\\n\\nThe major in economics is designed for students who wish to obtain a systematic introduction \\nto the theoretical and empirical techniques of economics. It provides an opportunity to learn \\neconomics as a social science, to study the process of drawing inferences from bodies of data \\nand testing hypotheses against observation, and to apply economic theory to particular social \\nproblems. Such problems include economic development, the functioning of economic \\ninstitutions (i.e., financial markets, labor markets, corporations, government agencies), \\nand current policy issues (i.e., the federal budget, poverty, the environment, globalization, \\nderegulation). The major is a useful preparation for graduate study in economics, law, business, \\nfinance, or public administration, but majors have gone on to medicine, environmental policy, \\nand many other fields.\\n\\nRequirements for the Major in Economics\\nThere are seven required courses for the major: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\ncore: Economics 2555, 2556, and 2557\\nthree advanced topics courses numbered in the 3000s, at least one of which must be \\ndesignated as a seminar (course number higher than 3500)\\none additional course in economics numbered 2000 or higher\\n\\nEither Economics 1050 or 1101 serve as prerequisites for Economics 1102 and because \\nthese are prerequisites for most other economics courses, most students begin their work in \\neconomics with these introductory courses. Prospective majors are encouraged to take at least \\none core course by the end of the sophomore year, and all three core courses should normally \\nbe completed by the end of the junior year. Advanced topics courses normally have one or \\nmore of Economics 2555, 2556, and 2557 as prerequisites. An independent study can be used \\nto satisfy no more than one major requirement; an intermediate independent study can satisfy \\na 2000-level elective or an advanced independent study can satisfy a 3000-level non-seminar.\\nAll prospective majors and minors are required to complete Mathematics 1600 or its \\nequivalent prior to enrolling in the core courses. Students who aspire to advanced work in \\neconomics, e.g., an honors thesis and/or graduate study in a discipline related to economics, \\nare strongly encouraged to master multivariate calculus (Mathematics 1800) and linear \\nalgebra (Mathematics 2000) early in their careers. Such students are also encouraged to \\ntake Mathematics 2606 instead of Economics 2557 as a prerequisite for Economics 3516. \\nThe Economics 2557 requirement is waived for students who complete Mathematics 2606 \\nand Economics 3516. Students should consult the Department of Economics about other \\nmathematics courses that are especially useful for advanced study in economics.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cInterdisciplinary Major\\nThe department participates in an interdisciplinary major in mathematics and economics.

Drawing primarily on the humanities and the social \\nsciences, courses in GSWS explore the social construction of identity and experience as well as \\nhow difference, marginalization, and resistance exist within and across cultures and historical \\nperiods. In its curriculum and its faculty research, GSWS explores the multiple directions that \\nfeminist and queer scholarship and activism take locally, nationally, and transnationally.\\n\\nRequirements for the Major in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies\\nThe major consists of nine courses, including three required core courses. \\nRequired courses:\\n\\na GSWS-designated, advanced-level capstone seminar\\n\\n•  GSWS 1101, Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies\\n•  GSWS 2201, Feminist Theory; or GSWS 2001, Queer Theory\\n• \\n•  The six remaining courses for the major may be chosen from the set of GSWS \\ncourses, or from a set of courses in other disciplines that have been approved \\nby the Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies Program Committee to count \\ntoward the major.

Courses that count toward the major or minor must be \\ntaken for regular letter grades (not Credit/D/Fail).\\nStudy Away: In their sophomore year, students anticipating study away from \\nBowdoin should discuss with the departmental advisor a plan for the history major \\nthat includes work at Bowdoin and elsewhere. Students participating in approved \\noff-campus study may count one history course per semester toward the history \\nmajor or minor. In exceptional cases, students may petition to receive credit \\nfor more than one course per semester toward the history major. In all cases, a \\nmaximum of three history courses taken away from Bowdoin may count toward the \\nhistory major, pending review.\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n•  Honors: To be eligible to register for honors, a student must have the equivalent of \\na B+ average in courses taken in the department and the approval of a thesis advisor. \\nAll history majors seeking departmental honors must research and write an honors \\nthesis.\\nLanguages: History majors are encouraged to develop competence in one or more \\nforeign languages and to use this competence in their historical reading and research. \\nKnowledge of a foreign language is particularly important for students planning \\ngraduate work.\\nAdvanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB): Students who received a \\nfour or higher on the Global History AP exam, US History AP exam, or European \\nHistory AP exam—or a five or higher on the History IB exam—must complete a \\nhistory course at the 2000 level or above with a minimum grade of B in order to \\nreceive a college credit for the exam. AP/IB credits do not count toward the history \\nmajor or any college requirements; credits from AP/IB exams only count toward \\ntotal credits needed for graduation. If a student has scores for more than one AP/\\nIB History exam, only one total credit is awarded.

This course often uses case studies from different religions \\nto illustrate thematic questions in the academic study of religion. Each year, the \\ndepartment offers an additional 1000-level course, such as Religion 1150 or \\nReligion 1115.\\n2000-level courses: The bulk of the department’s offerings are at this level.

There are intensive Russian language immersion programs in Moscow, St. Petersburg, \\nIrkutsk, Yaroslavl, and other cities that are open to students who have taken at least two \\nsemesters of college Russian. Programs and proposed course work should be discussed with \\nthe Russian department. Russian majors returning from study away are expected to take two \\nregularly offered courses in the department unless exceptions are granted by the chair. Two \\ncourses from a one-semester study away program may be counted toward the Russian major; \\nthree courses may be counted toward the major from a yearlong program.

A research proposal outlining the project is due to the advisor and \\n\\n119\\n\\n\\x0cRussian\\ndepartment chair by April 15 of the junior year. The proposal must be well-focused and \\nmust address an area of study in which the student can already demonstrate basic knowledge; \\nhonors candidates completing a Russian language, literature, and culture concentration in \\nthe major are required to choose a topic containing a strong literary, cinematic, or linguistic \\ncomponent. The bibliography should incorporate several primary and secondary sources in \\nthe original language; in most cases, the project itself is written in English. Expected length \\nand format are determined in consultation with the faculty advisor on a project-specific basis. \\nThe honors project is completed in the context of two semesters of advanced independent \\nstudy in the senior year; one of these semesters may be counted toward major requirements. In \\naddition, candidates for honors are required to take at least one regularly offered course in the \\nRussian department in the senior year. The student must receive a grade of A- or higher on the \\ncompleted honors project to receive departmental honors.\\n\\nPost-Graduate Study\\nStudents planning post-graduate study should note that they present a stronger application if \\nthey take additional courses beyond what is strictly required to complete the Russian major. \\nIn particular, at least two courses on topics in Russian literature or culture at the 3000 level \\n(taught entirely in Russian) are strongly recommended to all graduate school-bound Russian \\nmajors, regardless of concentration. Students wishing to pursue graduate study in the field of \\nRussian language and literature should take additional courses on literary topics at the 2000 \\nor 3000 level covering a wide range of literary historical periods and genres (at a minimum, at \\nleast one course each focused on nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literature, \\npoetic genres, and prose genres). Students wishing to pursue graduate studies in an allied field \\n(e.g., Russian politics, Russian history, Russian musicology, Russian cinema studies, and so \\non) are advised to take additional relevant courses both in the Russian department and in their \\nfield(s) of interest. All students who intend to pursue a graduate degree in a Russian-related \\nfield or subfield are strongly advised to consult with faculty on the design of their major \\nand discuss the options of research projects through advanced independent studies, honors \\nprojects, fellowship-funded summer research, and intensive Russian language immersion \\nprograms.\\n\\nAdditional information\\n\\n• \\n\\nA first-year seminar on an approved topic may be counted toward the major or \\nminor in place of a 2000-level course.\\n\\n•  To be counted toward the Russian major or minor, courses must be taken for a letter \\n\\ngrade (not Credit/D/Fail) and must receive a grade of at least C-.\\n\\n120\\n\\n\\x0cSociology and Anthropology\\n\\nSociology and Anthropology\\n\\nKrista E.

In addition to notable print and manuscript collections, historically recognized as \\namong Bowdoin’s hallmarks of excellence, the Library offers a wealth of electronic resources \\nand instructional programs that enhance their use.\\nThe Library’s website (library.bowdoin.edu) is the portal to the combined Colby, Bates, and \\nBowdoin library catalog (CBBcat), rich collections of electronic and print resources, and \\nessential digital research and discovery tools. The Library’s collections, developed over a period \\nof 200 years, exceed one million volumes and include more than 80,000 print and electronic \\nperiodicals, 450 online indexes and databases, as well as e-books, audiovisual items, maps, \\nphotographs, a growing repository of born-digital content, and over 5,600 linear feet of \\nmanuscripts and archival records.\\nResearch librarians and faculty partner to encourage the use of scholarly resources in all \\ndisciplines and to teach students to identify, select, and evaluate information for course \\nwork and independent scholarship. Students receive information literacy instruction in their \\nfirst-year seminars, and librarians provide personalized assistance in using library resources \\nthroughout the academic year.\\nInterlibrary loan and document delivery services allow students and faculty to request materials \\nnot held at Bowdoin; most journal articles are delivered electronically, and books arrive daily \\nfrom Colby and Bates colleges and other libraries in New England and worldwide.\\n\\nLibrary Locations and Collections\\nThe Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, the main library building, houses humanities and social \\nsciences materials, the George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives, and a \\ndepository of federal and Maine State documents. Hawthorne-Longfellow features an array of \\npopular student study spaces, ranging from quiet individual carrels to technologically equipped \\ngroup learning spaces, as well as an electronic classroom for instruction, a student gallery, \\nand meeting rooms for public events and student exhibits, presentations, and other activities. \\nThe Media Commons features teaching and screening spaces; audio and video recording and \\nproduction studios; workstations to support media viewing, capture, and design; and the \\nstate-of-the-art Telepresence Classroom, equipped with audio-sensitive cameras, multiple \\nhigh-definition screens, and interactive whiteboards. The Research Lab, the Library’s most \\nrecent addition, was developed as an active and flexible space for formal and informal learning \\ninteractions among students, faculty, and research librarians. The lab supports student-librarian \\ncollaborations, class-based instruction sessions, group study, and peer tutoring. The Library \\nalso houses Bowdoin’s new Student Testing and Study Area (opening in the fall of 2018) that \\nfacilitates students and faculty needing to schedule alternative exams and assignments. \\nThe George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives includes rare books \\nand manuscripts of unusual depth for a college library, plus images, recordings, and historical \\ndocuments of the College, as well as the personal papers of notable alumni, including Senator \\nGeorge J. Mitchell (Class of 1954). These materials afford an invaluable opportunity for \\n\\n127\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\nundergraduates to experience conducting original research; using primary resources in Special \\nCollections & Archives is a distinguishing characteristic of a Bowdoin education.\\nThe Government Documents Collection provides the Bowdoin community and the public \\naccess to print and digital government information reflecting over two centuries of federal and \\nstate history.\\nThe Hatch Science Library offers research and instructional services and a variety of individual \\nand group study facilities in support of its science-related print and digital resources.\\nThe William Pierce Art Library and the Robert Beckwith Music Library, located adjacent \\nto classrooms and offices for those departments, serve as centers for research and study. The \\nArt Library offers a strong collection of art books and exhibition catalogs. The Music Library’s \\nextensive collections include books, scores, sound recordings, and videos.\\n\\nBowdoin College Museum of Art\\n\\nThe Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the cornerstone of the arts and culture at Bowdoin, is \\none of the earliest collegiate art collections in the nation. It came into being through the 1811 \\nbequest of James Bowdoin III of seventy European paintings and a portfolio of 141 old master \\ndrawings. Over the years, the collection has been expanded through the generosity of the \\nBowdoin family, alumni, and friends, and now numbers more than 22,000 objects, including \\npaintings, sculpture, works on paper, decorative arts, and artifacts from prehistory to the \\npresent and from civilizations around the world.\\nThe Museum’s landmark Walker Art Building was commissioned for the College by Harriet \\nand Sophia Walker in honor of their uncle, a Boston businessman who had supported the \\ncreation of the first art gallery at Bowdoin in the mid-nineteenth century. The Walker sisters, \\nencyclopedic collectors and supporters of art education, stipulated that the building be used \\nexclusively for art purposes. Designed by Charles Follen McKim, the building was completed \\nin 1894 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The brick, limestone, and granite \\nfaçade, based on Renaissance prototypes, overlooks a broad staircase where generations of \\nBowdoin graduates receive their diplomas.\\nThe antiquities collections contain over 1,800 Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, and Roman artifacts \\nand constitute one of the most comprehensive compilations of ancient art in any college \\nmuseum. European art includes paintings, illustrated manuscripts, sculptures, and decorative \\narts. Among twelve European Renaissance and Baroque paintings given in 1961 by the Kress \\nFoundation is a panel depicting nymphs pursued by a youth that recently has been attributed \\nto the young Fra Angelico. The collection of prints, drawings, and photographs is large and \\nvaried, numbering more than 8,000 works and representing artists from Rembrandt and \\nRubens through Callot, Goya, and Manet to Picasso and Warhol.\\nThe Museum’s American collection includes an important grouping of colonial and Federal \\nportraits, with, for example, seven major paintings by Gilbert Stuart, including the famous \\npresidential portraits of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, together with other works by \\nRobert Feke, John Copley, Thomas Sully, and Joseph Blackburn. Among other notable works \\nare the murals commissioned by McKim to decorate the Museum’s rotunda by the four leading \\npainters of the American Renaissance: Elihu Vedder, Kenyon Cox, Abbott Thayer, and John \\nLaFarge. The collection also includes works by significant nineteenth- and twentieth-century \\nartists such as Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, John Sloan, Rockwell Kent, Marsden Hartley, \\nand Andrew Wyeth, and an archive of memorabilia from Winslow Homer’s Maine studio.\\n\\n128\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\n\\nNon-western materials range from Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Southeast Asian prints, \\nink paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts to modest but distinguished holdings of African, \\nPacific, Pre-Columbian, and Native American artifacts.\\nRenovations, designed by Machado and Silvetti Associates and completed in 2007, include \\nexpanded galleries, a seminar room, and improved art storage facilities. The restored Museum \\nretains the building’s iconic architectural features and provides state-of-the-art climate control \\nand mechanical systems. A dramatic glass and bronze entry pavilion houses a glass elevator \\nand “floating” steel staircase, while a rear addition to the building features an expansive glass \\ncurtain wall behind which the Museum has installed its five celebrated ancient Assyrian relief \\nsculptures.\\nThe Museum, open to the public at no charge, is a teaching facility, with the core of its mission \\nto keep its rich collections within immediate reach of Bowdoin students, faculty, scholars, and \\nvisitors from near and far. Its active emphasis on the study of original objects as an integral \\npart of the Bowdoin curriculum makes the Museum the ultimate cross-disciplinary and \\nmulticultural enterprise. Although online resources are no substitute for an actual visit, the \\ncollections can be searched and information on Museum programs and publications found on \\nthe website at bowdoin.edu/art-museum.\\n\\nPeary-MacMillan Arctic Museum  \\n\\nand Arctic Studies Center\\n\\nThe Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum was founded in 1967 in honor of two famous Arctic \\nexplorers and Bowdoin alumni, Admirals Robert E. Peary (Class of 1877) and Donald B. \\nMacMillan (Class of 1898). On April 6, 1909, after a lifetime of Arctic exploration, Peary \\nheaded the first team of people to reach the North Pole. MacMillan, a crew member on \\nPeary’s last expedition, spent the next forty-seven years exploring Labrador, Baffin Island, \\nEllesmere Island, and Greenland. He used the Bowdoin, a schooner he had built for work in \\nice-laden northern waters, on most of his expeditions. MacMillan took college students to the \\nArctic and introduced them to the natural history and anthropology of the North. He was \\nnot the first to involve Bowdoin students in Arctic exploration, however. In 1860, Paul A. \\nChadbourne, a professor of chemistry and natural history, had sailed along the Labrador and \\nWest Greenland coasts with students from Williams and Bowdoin. Professor Leslie Lee took \\nBowdoin alumni and students to the same regions in 1891, paving the way for the program’s \\nNorth Atlantic focus.\\nThe Museum’s collections include equipment, paintings, and photographs relating to the \\nhistory of Arctic exploration; natural history specimens; artifacts and drawings made by \\nindigenous people of Arctic North America; contemporary Canadian Inuit carvings and prints; \\nand Alaskan Iñupiat and Yup’ik carvings, masks, and baleen and grass baskets. The Museum \\nhas large collections of ethnographic photographs and films taken on the expeditions of \\nMacMillan and Robert Bartlett, an explorer and captain who sailed northern waters for nearly \\nfifty years. Diaries, logs, and correspondence relating to the Museum’s collections are housed in \\nthe Special Collections & Archives section of the College’s Hawthorne-Longfellow Library.\\nThe Museum is located on the first floor of Hubbard Hall. The building was named for \\nGeneral Thomas Hubbard of the Class of 1857, a generous benefactor of the College and \\nfinancial supporter of Peary’s Arctic ventures. Generous donations from members of the Class \\nof 1925, together with gifts from George B. Knox of the Class of 1929, a former trustee, \\nand other interested alumni and friends, made the Museum a reality. Ian M. White, former \\n\\n129\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\ndirector of the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, who sailed with MacMillan in 1950, \\ndesigned the Museum’s first exhibitions.\\nThe Arctic Studies Center was established in 1985 as a result of a generous matching grant \\nfrom the Russell and Janet Doubleday Foundation to endow the directorship of the Center, in \\nrecognition of the Doubledays’ close relationship to MacMillan. The Center links the resources \\nof the Museum and Library with teaching and research efforts, and hosts lectures, workshops, \\nsymposia, and educational outreach programs. Continued support from the Doubleday \\nEndowment, friends of the College, the Kane Lodge Foundation, Inc., and federal grants have \\nallowed the College’s Arctic- and North Atlantic-focused programs to grow. Through course \\nofferings, field research programs, student employment opportunities, and special events, the \\nCenter promotes anthropological, archaeological, and environmental investigations of North \\nAtlantic and Arctic regions.\\n\\nArts Facilities\\n\\nBowdoin has a deep and historic commitment to the role of the arts in a liberal education, \\nwhich is supported by state-of-the-art facilities and numerous opportunities for participation \\nin the vibrant student performance and art exhibition scene on campus. For students wishing \\nto specialize in an artistic field, Bowdoin’s programs offer exceptional flexibility and the \\nopportunity for in-depth study with recognized faculty. Bowdoin also hosts an exciting array \\nof performances and exhibitions, bringing renowned artists and scholars to campus from all \\nparts of the world. \\n\\nRobert H. and Blythe Bickel Edwards Center for Art and Dance\\nThe Robert H. and Blythe Bickel Edwards Center for Art and Dance, an ambitious renovation \\nof a former landmark elementary school completed in 2013, offers a dynamic and communal \\ncenter for the full range of activities in the visual arts and dance on campus. The building \\ncontains two dance studios, painting and drawing studios, classrooms for critique, exhibition \\nspaces, and state-of-the-art facilities including a wood shop, print shop, kiln, analog darkroom, \\nand digital media lab. The Edwards Center for Art and Dance enables faculty and students \\nengaged in dance, painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, printmaking, and digital arts to \\nwork together under a single roof, fostering a cohesive arts community and opportunities for \\nartistic and intellectual synergies.\\n\\nGibson Hall\\nGibson Hall houses the Department of Music and offers rehearsal and practice rooms, \\nteaching studios, the Beckwith Music Library, an electronic music lab, a state-of-the-art \\nprojection system, faculty offices, a sixty-eight-seat classroom/recital hall, and a more intimate \\nseminar room. It is located on the main quadrangle between the Walker Art Building and the \\nHawthorne-Longfellow Library.\\n\\nPickard and Wish Theaters\\nMemorial Hall includes performance, rehearsal, set construction, and instructional facilities. \\nThe centerpiece is Pickard Theater, a 600-seat theater with proscenium stage equipped with \\na full fly system and state-of-the-art lighting, sound, and video equipment. Wish Theater \\naddresses the needs of experimental, educational theater in a flexible and intimate black box \\nspace that includes high-tech lighting and sound. Memorial Hall also features a seminar room, \\na rehearsal studio—which is also used for smaller performances and student productions—and \\na dance studio. \\n130\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\n\\nStudzinski Recital Hall\\nThe world-class Studzinski Recital Hall is a transformation of the Curtis Pool building into a \\n280-seat, state-of-the-art facility for small- and medium-sized musical performances. The hall \\nincludes a rehearsal room, nine practice rooms, and a number of Steinway pianos. Kanbar \\nAuditorium features raked seating, exceptional acoustics, advanced technical capabilities, and \\na stage designed to accommodate different performance configurations and types of musical \\nprograms, including classical, jazz, electronic, and world music. \\n\\nVisual Arts Center\\nThe Visual Arts Center houses the faculty in art history and Digital and Computational \\nStudies, the Pierce Art Library, Beam Classroom, and Kresge Auditorium. \\n\\nCenter for Learning and Teaching\\n\\nBowdoin College’s Center for Learning and Teaching (CLT) houses a group of programs \\nthat support learning and teaching throughout the curriculum. The programs offer writing \\nassistance, peer tutoring, academic mentoring, study groups, and support for multilingual \\nstudents. The programs are housed in Kanbar Hall, Room 102, and work cooperatively to \\nenhance Bowdoin’s curricular resources and to strengthen students’ academic experience. The \\nprograms are described below.\\nFaculty and staff may individually consult with a CLT staff member on any topic related \\nto teaching and learning at the College. Intentional Pedagogy workshops are offered for \\nfaculty to engage with the scholarship of teaching and learning. Other workshops and lunch \\nseminars on topics related to teaching and learning at Bowdoin are offered monthly during \\nthe semester. Book groups allow faculty and staff to engage substantively with topics such as \\nstereotype threat (Whistling Vivaldi) and academic resilience (Grit), as well as more pedagogical \\nfocused themes from Teaching Across Cultural Strengths and The Spark of Learning. Community \\nconversations are facilitated by the CLT through a series of Bear in Mind dialogues that \\ngrapple with issues such as implicit bias and imposter syndrome, bringing together diverse \\nstakeholders to both raise awareness and strategize on ways to improve campus climate and \\ninclusive excellence. The Teaching Triangles program provides faculty an opportunity to gain \\nnew insight into their teaching and students’ learning through a non-evaluative, formative \\nprocess of reciprocal classroom visits and reflection. Guest speakers deepen understanding of \\ntopics essential to effective teaching and learning in higher education. The Faculty Fellows \\nprogram is a yearlong, immersive experience for faculty in reflective practice on teaching and \\nlearning with the specific goal of enhancing equitable and inclusive learning environments for \\nstudents. Through monthly meetings, workshops, a May institute, and access to funding for \\nteaching innovation, an annual faculty learning community of approximately ten fellows will \\nresearch and discuss challenges to student learning and explore culturally inclusive pedagogies, \\nall to inform the redesign of a course.\\n\\nThe Baldwin Program for Academic Development\\nThe Baldwin Program for Academic Development opened in 1999–2000 with the mission \\nof creating a space in which students, faculty, and staff members can address issues related to \\nlearning at Bowdoin College. Established through a gift to the College by Linda G. Baldwin ’73, \\nthe program offers resources to help students attain their academic goals and faculty to enhance \\nstudent learning.\\n\\n131\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\nBased on an individualized and holistic approach to learning, the program offers activities and \\nservices such as study skills workshops and individual consultation with peer academic mentors. \\nMentors help fellow students assess their academic strengths and weaknesses and develop \\nindividually tailored time management, organizational, and study strategies. Mentors may be \\nparticularly useful to students encountering difficulty balancing the academic and social demands \\nof college life; struggling to find more effective approaches to understanding, learning, and \\nremembering new material; experiencing problems with procrastination; or simply achieving the \\nself-structuring demanded by an independent course or honors project.\\n\\nQuantitative Reasoning Program\\nThe Quantitative Reasoning (QR) Program was established in 1996 to assist with the \\nintegration of quantitative reasoning throughout the curriculum and to encourage students \\nto develop competence and confidence in using quantitative information. The program \\nwas established in recognition of the increasing demand to understand and use quantitative \\ninformation in college-level work, in employment situations, and for effective citizenship.\\nThe QR Program assists students in a variety of ways. Entering students are tested to assess \\ntheir proficiency with quantitative material. Utilizing the test results and other indicators, the \\ndirector of Quantitative Reasoning and faculty advisors counsel students regarding appropriate \\ncourses to fulfill their Mathematical, Computational, or Statistical Reasoning (MCSR) \\ndistribution requirement, including placement in the Mathematics 1050: Quantitative \\nReasoning course. In addition, students are encouraged to take courses across the curriculum \\nthat enhance their quantitative skills. The QR Program supplements many of the quantitative \\ncourses by providing small study groups led by trained peer tutors, as well as drop-in tutoring. \\nUpon the request of instructors, workshops on special topics are also provided by the QR \\nProgram. One-on-one tutoring is available on a limited basis.\\n\\nWriting and Rhetoric Program\\nCommunication takes many forms at Bowdoin. The support that we offer for writers and \\nspeakers is equally diverse. We understand that there are many ways to communicate, multiple \\napproaches to teaching and writing, and more than one writing process. The Writing and \\nRhetoric Program offers students and faculty resources to help facilitate more clear and \\neffective communication. Student resources include: ongoing workshops, individual advising \\nand consultations, and feedback and revision strategies for presentations (with options to \\nrecord presentations).\\n\\nThe Writing Project\\nThe Writing Project is based on the premise that students are uniquely qualified to serve as \\nintelligent, empathetic, and helpful readers of one another’s writing. As collaborators rather \\nthan authorities, peer writing assistants facilitate the writing process for fellow students by \\nproviding helpful feedback while encouraging writers to retain an active and authoritative role \\nin writing and revising their work. Each semester, the Writing Project assigns specially selected \\nand trained writing assistants to a variety of courses by request of the instructor. The assistants \\nread and comment on early drafts of papers and meet with the writers individually to help \\nthem expand and refine their ideas, clarify connections, and improve sentence structure. After \\nrevisions have been completed, each student submits a final paper to the instructor along with \\nthe draft and the assistant’s comments. Students in any course on campus may also reserve \\nconferences with a writing assistant in the Writing Workshop, open each week from Sunday \\nthrough Thursday.\\n\\n132\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\n\\nStudents interested in becoming writing assistants apply before spring break. Those accepted \\nenroll in a fall semester course on the theory and practice of teaching writing, offered through \\nthe Department of Education. Successful completion of the course qualifies students to serve \\nas tutors in later semesters, when they receive a stipend for their work.\\n\\nEnglish for Multilingual Students\\nStudents who are multilingual or who have non-native-English-speaking parents may work \\nindividually with the English for Multilingual Students advisor. Students may seek help with \\nunderstanding assignments and readings and attend to grammar, outlining, revising, and \\nscholarly writing conventions. Specific attention to pronunciation and oral presentation skills \\nis also offered. Any student wishing to make an appointment with the English for Multilingual \\nStudents advisor is welcome.\\n\\nTHRIVE Initiative\\nTHRIVE is a college-wide initiative designed to foster achievement, belonging, mentorship, \\nand transition. Historically, many low-income and first-generation students as well as those \\ntraditionally underrepresented on college campuses have described their higher education \\nexperience as one of survival. This initiative transforms the college experience for these \\nstudents from merely surviving to thriving. THRIVE comprises a range of undertakings, \\nincluding academic enrichment, service and leadership development, peer mentoring, and \\nfinancial support. It draws on best practices for inclusive excellence and fosters innovative \\ncurricular and pedagogical approaches to instruction. THRIVE is located in Banister Hall \\nand serves as both a point and place of connection for previously existing academic support \\nprograms, including Bowdoin Advising Program in Support of Academic Excellence (BASE), \\nBowdoin Science Experience (BSE), Bowdoin Science Scholars and Peer Mentoring, as well as \\nthe College’s new Geoffrey Canada Scholars Program (GCS).\\n\\nField Stations\\n\\nThe Bowdoin Pines\\nAdjacent to the campus on either side of the Bath Road is a 33-acre site known as the Bowdoin \\nPines. Cathedral white pines, some of them 135 years old, tower over the site, which is a rare \\nexample of one of Maine’s few remaining old-growth forests. For biology students, the Pines \\nprovides an easily accessible outdoor laboratory. For other students, the site offers a place for \\na walk between classes, an inspirational setting for creating art, or simply a bit of solitude. \\nA system of trails within the Pines makes the site accessible to students and community \\nmembers.\\n\\nBowdoin Scientific Station\\nThe College maintains an island-based scientific field station in the Bay of Fundy, New \\nBrunswick, Canada, where qualified students can conduct research in ecology, animal behavior, \\nmarine biology, botany, geology, and meteorology. Every summer the station also supports a \\nBowdoin student as an artist-in-residence. Art projects have been in visual arts, poetry, fiction, \\nscience writing, film, and music. The Bowdoin Scientific Station (BSS) is located on a cluster \\nof islands in the Grand Manan Archipelago known as Three Islands. The BSS consists of Kent, \\nSheep, and Hay Islands, which are owned entirely by the College. Kent Island, the largest of \\nThree Islands (250 acres), was presented to the College in 1936 by J. Sterling Rockefeller. In \\n2003, the College acquired neighboring Hay and Sheep Islands to help preserve the unique \\n\\n133\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\nenvironment offered by the three islands. The BSS has an international reputation, with more \\nthan 200 peer-reviewed publications, many of which are coauthored by students.\\nThe BSS is a major seabird breeding ground. Its location makes it a concentration point for \\nmigrating birds in spring and fall. The famous Fundy tides create excellent opportunities for \\nthe study of marine biology. The BSS also features old field habitat for pollination studies and \\ndeciduous and coniferous forests.\\nStudents from Bowdoin and other institutions select problems for investigation at the BSS \\nduring the summer and conduct independent fieldwork with the advice and assistance of \\na faculty director. Students have the opportunity to collaborate with graduate students and \\nfaculty from various universities and colleges. Three-day field trips to the BSS are a feature of \\nBowdoin’s courses in ecology and marine biology. \\n\\nSchiller Coastal Studies Center\\nSchiller Coastal Studies Center occupies a 118-acre coastal site that is twelve miles from the \\ncampus on Orr’s Island, once known as Thalheimer Farm. The Center offers the Bowdoin \\nMarine Science Semester each fall, and interdisciplinary teaching and research throughout \\nthe College.\\nThe Center’s facilities include the Marine Laboratory renovated in 2014, allowing \\nresearchers to study a diversity of benthic and pelagic marine organisms and systems. The \\nMarine Laboratory includes a dry-laboratory classroom that features light microscopy and \\nmolecular biology capabilities. The site has 2.5 miles of coastline, a dock and pier facility, \\nand access to a monitoring buoy that provides continuous data from Harpswell Sound. \\nThe Center maintains a small boat fleet including the twenty-eight-foot research vessel, \\nthe R/V A.O.K., twenty-one-foot parker, sixteen-foot maritime skiff, and a thirteen-foot \\nBoston Whaler. Other facilities include the off-the-grid Terrestrial Lab (T-Lab), a space \\nthat embodies the multidisciplinary approach of the Center in that it is used as both an art \\nstudio and laboratory, and the Bowdoin sailing team’s Leighton Sailing Center. A centrally \\nlocated farmhouse serves as a meeting space with a forty-five-person capacity and a facility \\nfor computationally demanding science laboratories. Classes, students, and faculty from all \\ndisciplines use the Center for fieldwork, research, lab work, meetings, and recreation.\\nThe Schiller Coastal Studies Center site is surrounded on three sides by the ocean and \\nencompasses open fields, orchards, and old-growth spruce-fir forest. A 4-mile interpretive \\ntrail runs through the site, offering students and the local community a glimpse into the \\ncultural and natural history of the property and surrounding coastal waters.\\n\\nStudent Fellowships and Research\\n\\nThe Office of Student Fellowships and Research connects Bowdoin students to merit-based \\nacademic experiences. Often, the application forms for these merit-based scholarships and \\nfellowships require applicants to concisely articulate their past experiences, interests, and future \\naspirations. While sometimes challenging, this requirement encourages students to undergo \\na process of self-assessment and self-development. The Office of Student Fellowships and \\nResearch is committed to making the application process a worthwhile learning experience for \\nall students, regardless of whether a fellowship is awarded.\\nThe Office of Student Fellowships and Research works with students and alumni to identify \\nand to apply for relevant nationally competitive fellowships and scholarships such as Fulbright, \\nMarshall, Rhodes, and Watson. Numerous Bowdoin students receive these prestigious awards \\n\\n134\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\n\\neach year, enabling them to engage in a variety of activities including spending time overseas, \\nconducting independent research, receiving support toward their undergraduate tuition, and \\nattending graduate school.\\nThe Office of Student Fellowships and Research also strives to inform all Bowdoin students \\nabout undergraduate research opportunities, primarily at Bowdoin, but also at institutions \\nacross the country. Each year the College awards Bowdoin research fellowships to more than \\n200 Bowdoin students to carry out faculty-mentored research across all disciplines. A Bowdoin \\nresearch fellowship allows a student to delve deeply into a research question and can lead to \\nan enhanced independent study or honors project, coauthoring a paper with a faculty mentor, \\nor presenting findings at a professional meeting. These research experiences enrich students’ \\nundergraduate experience, make students more competitive for entrance to graduate school, \\nand prepare students to successfully undertake graduate study.\\n\\nJoseph McKeen Center for the Common Good\\n\\nAt the opening of Bowdoin College in 1802, President Joseph McKeen declared that:\\n\\n…literary institutions are founded and endowed for the common good, and not \\nfor the private advantage of those who resort to them for education. It is not that \\nthey may be enabled to pass through life in an easy or reputable manner, but that \\ntheir mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the benefit of society. If \\nit be true, that no man should live to himself, we may safely assert, that every man \\nwho has been aided by a public institution to acquire an education, and to qualify \\nhimself for usefulness, is under peculiar obligations to exert his talents for the  \\npublic good.\\n\\nEncouraging students to live up to McKeen’s vision is a central mission of the College as a \\nwhole, and the Joseph McKeen Center for the Common Good provides opportunities for \\nstudents to discover the ways in which their unique talents, passions, and academic pursuits \\ncan be used for the “benefit of society” through public engagement.\\nHoused in Banister Hall, the McKeen Center supports work that takes place across the \\ncampus, in local communities, and at selected locations around the world. The Center assists \\nstudent-led volunteer organizations that provide service to the local community through \\nactivities such as mentoring, tutoring, visiting with senior citizens, serving meals at the \\nlocal soup kitchen, and working with immigrant populations in nearby Portland. Fostering \\nstudent initiative and leadership, the Center provides opportunities for students to propose \\nand lead alternative winter and spring break trips that connect their peers with community \\norganizations to address public issues in places ranging from Los Angeles to Baltimore, and \\nfrom Northern Maine to Guatemala. The Center also houses the Bowdoin Public Service \\nInitiative, a multifaceted program designed to explore ways to serve the common good \\nthrough government and public service. In all areas, the McKeen Center encourages students \\nto reflect upon their public engagement and connect these experiences to curricular and \\nvocational interests.\\nIn coordination with other departments, the Center administers summer fellowships for \\nstudents interested in non-profit internships and provides funding for international service. It \\nassists students in finding community partners with whom to engage in community-connected \\nindependent research and honors projects and helps identify courses at the College that \\nprovide context for the issues students address through their community work. The McKeen \\nCenter supports faculty in developing and teaching community-engaged courses that take \\n\\n135\\n\\n\\x0cEducational Resources and Facilities\\nstudents out of the classroom to conduct interviews, record oral histories, develop curriculum \\nfor schools, and collect scientific data in conjunction with community partners.\\nThe Center also encourages and helps sponsor campus-wide events that challenge students, \\nfaculty, and staff to examine the varied meanings of public service and the “common good.” \\nThese events include the What Matters dialogue series, the Leading for the Common Good \\nseminar, and Common Good Day, a traditional day of service that connects Bowdoin \\nstudents, faculty, staff, and alumni with the local community each fall.\\n\\nInformation and Technology\\n\\nTechnology is embedded in the fabric of the Bowdoin College experience. Students, faculty, \\nand staff have access to the latest software, experienced consultants, and targeted training to \\ntake advantage of technical resources. The Information Technology (IT) team consults with \\nfaculty, students, and staff and works in partnership with departments to provide reliable and \\ninnovative solutions.\\nBowdoin is one of the most robust wired and wireless institutions in the nation. Students and \\nfaculty have access to high performance computing and over 600 supported software packages \\nproviding them with the latest tools to assist with their studies, analysis, and research. A full-\\ntime, professionally staffed Service Desk supports Mac, Windows, and Linux computers and \\nsoftware applications. The student-run Service Desk works with students, answering questions \\nand resolving software and hardware issues during evenings and weekends. Software support is \\navailable twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\\nThe campus has multiple academic computer labs, a 24-hour public lab, over thirty public \\nprinters, and 3-D printers. Students are provided Microsoft’s Office 365 email, OneDrive \\nstorage, Microsoft Office, video conferencing capabilities, and cable television. There is a free \\nequipment Loaning Center that includes video- and audio-recording devices, projection, \\nlaptops, digital cameras, GoPros, and newer technology for testing and evaluation.\\nIT is constantly exploring technology trends and working to provide accessible, secure, and \\nstable services.\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\x0cStudent Affairs\\n\\nStudent Affairs\\n\\nA residential college adds significantly to the education of students when it provides the \\nopportunity for a distinctive and dynamic learning community to develop. In such a \\ncommunity, Bowdoin students are encouraged, both directly and indirectly, to engage \\nactively in a quest for knowledge both inside and outside the classroom, and to take \\nresponsibility for themselves, for others, and for their community. They are challenged to \\ngrow personally by constant contact with new experiences and different ways of viewing \\nthe world. Simultaneously, they are supported and encouraged by friends, faculty, staff, and \\nother community members and find opportunities for spontaneous as well as structured \\nactivities. Such a community promotes the intellectual and personal growth of individuals and \\nencourages mutual understanding and respect in the context of diversity.\\nThe programs and services provided by the Division of Student Affairs exist to support \\nstudents and the College in developing and maintaining the learning community. Staff \\nthroughout the Division of Student Affairs assist students with their studies, their leadership \\nand social growth, their well-being, and their future. The Bowdoin College Student Handbook \\nonline provides comprehensive information about student life and the programs and services \\nof the Division of Student Affairs. Additional information is available at bowdoin.edu.\\n\\nThe Academic Honor and Social Codes\\nThe success of the Academic Honor Code and Social Code requires the active commitment \\nof the College community. Since 1964, with revisions in 1977 and 1993, the community \\npledge of personal academic integrity has formed the basis for academic and social conduct at \\nBowdoin. The institution assumes that all Bowdoin students possess the attributes implied in \\nthe codes. Bowdoin College expects its students to be responsible for their behavior on and off \\nthe campus and to assure the same behavior of their guests.\\nThe Academic Honor Code plays a central role in the intellectual life at Bowdoin College. \\nStudents and faculty are obligated to ensure its success. Uncompromised intellectual \\ninquiry lies at the heart of a liberal education. Integrity is essential in creating an academic \\nenvironment dedicated to the development of independent modes of learning, analysis, \\njudgment, and expression. Academic dishonesty is antithetical to the College’s institutional \\nvalues and constitutes a violation of the Honor Code.\\nThe Social Code describes certain rights and responsibilities of Bowdoin College students. \\nWhile it imposes no specific morality on students, the College requires certain standards of \\nbehavior to secure the safety of the College community and ensure that the campus remains a \\ncenter of intellectual engagement.\\nIndividuals who suspect violations of the Academic Honor Code and/or Social Code should \\nnot attempt to resolve the issues independently, but are encouraged to refer their concerns \\nto the Office of the Dean of Students. The College reserves the right to impose sanctions on \\nstudents who violate these codes on or off campus. A thorough description of the Academic \\nHonor Code, the Social Code, and the disciplinary process is included in the Bowdoin College \\nStudent Handbook online at bowdoin.edu/studentaffairs/student-handbook/.\\n\\n \\n\\n137\\n\\n\\x0cOfficers of Instruction\\n\\nFaculty\\n\\nClayton S.
